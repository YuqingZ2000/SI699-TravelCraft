While a good part of the city's action centers around the fun and festive Harbor area, where street entertainers, open-air concerts, fireworks and parades abound, the surrounding neighborhoods offer all sorts of interesting landmarks, unique shops and delicious restaurants. Wander around Fells Point, the oldest section of Baltimore, reminiscent of an old English village, complete with pubs and cobblestone streets. Take the kids to the aquarium and check out the imaginative creations at the American Visionary Art Museum. Or stop by the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum for an in-depth look at the Great Bambino's life.

From historic places and harbor cruises to family friendly attractions and fabulous neighborhoods, Charm City is one of the top tourist destinations in the United States.","Baltimore is often neglected by tourists in favor of the East Coast's other great tourist cities, but this is a big mistake. If you head to this charming, vibrant city, you'll instantly see why. For a start, you'll smell the irresistible aroma of freshly cooked crabcakes or coddies. Baltimore does seafood like no other American city, and its local specialities are not to be missed. Alternatively, it could be the unique atmosphere of the city. When you head to an Orioles match or tour the stalls at Lexington Market, you'll feel like a native wherever you go. There are also centuries of history to explore, not to mention museums, galleries and music venues. It all makes Baltimore an exceptional tourist destination, and one that nobody should overlook. The Harbor Baltimore's harbor area is beautiful and packed with things to do. Kids can enjoy the Aquarium and the Science Center, while everyone can enjoy the chance to board historic ships like the USS Constellation. The Wire If you've been thrilled by the HBO series The Wire, why not visit where the action took place?

Check out Faidley Seafood or Pierpoint Restaurant for some of the best. Sports Whether you love NFL or Major League Baseball, Baltimore is a great sporting city. Check out the Orioles at Camden Yards or the Ravens at the M&T Bank Stadium. The atmosphere will be intense whichever option you choose. History Baltimore is one of America's oldest cities, and it's seen a lot of action over the past 250 years. The city was attacked by the British in 1812, became the hub of one of the world's first passenger railways in the 1840s, and pioneered women's rights in the 1890s. Now, it's full of historic sites like the Westminster Burying Ground (home to Edgar Allen Poe's grave), Fort McHenry and City Hall.","Baltimore, Maryland, is a city you should see at least once, regardless of whether you're just traveling through or intend to stay.  Celebrate your night in Baltimore with dinner and sightseeing aboard a luxury cruise on the Inner Harbor.

This is the old port and manufacturing center of the city but now has a more charming and post-industrial style, as it is full of local residents, restaurants, boutique shops and hotels.   Featured deals and activities:  Signature Spirit of Baltimore Dinner Cruise with Buffet Baltimore Dark History Haunted Walking Tour Baltimore Helicopter Sightseeing Tour Baltimore Inner Harbor Sightseeing Tour Walking Foodie Tour - Fells Point","It might have a gritty reputation but Baltimore, a vibrantly cosmopolitan city wrapped around a fork of the Chesapeake Bay, isn't as resolutely urban as you might imagine. Indeed, the centre is home to a series of rather charming art deco skyscrapers, while the city's 1920s boom is referenced in the increasing number of renovated speakeasies to reopen in recent years. More than anything else, Baltimore is dominated by its vast harbour, which alongside fishing boats and cargo ships, is a port for US Navy ships. Much of the harbour has benefited from gentrification and as a result, high-end restaurants, interesting shops and even a tiny city farm are found here. The area is also home to the vast National Aquarium and the Harborplace shopping mall, as well as baseball field Oriole Park. The West Side's redevelopment includes the city centre and Lexington Market. Established in 1782, the market still houses around 100 merchants. The once shabby historic districts of Fell's Point, Federal Hill and Harbor East have also been revamped and, like Mount Vernon and Little Italy, are now packed with trendy bars, shops and eateries. Baltimore is also home to a thriving culinary scene, much of it based on proximity to the Chesapeake Bay and the oyster beds that dot its shores north of the city. As a result, the city's many oyster bars are second to none, while the millions of crabs that live in the chilly waters of the bay have become something of a speciality, whether boiled whole or served up in a delicious Maryland crabcake. Bountiful nature is a theme that also applies to the surrounding countryside, with red barns and rolling farmland that wouldn't look out of place in Scandinavia. The area is also home to scores of Civil War sites, British outposts, and the poignant Reginald F. Lewis Museum, which retells the dark days of slavery.","Today's Baltimore is a vibrant community that honors the past while keeping a keen eye on the future. Our city is where you can see the largest public collection of Matisse in the world (for free!), sip a craft beer in the sanctuary of a converted church and stay in a four-star hotel poised atop an historic recreation pier. But the Baltimore experience is about more than exploring neighborhoods and cultural sites. To really know this place, you have to meet our artists, provocateurs and visionaries who call Charm City home. ","Once pegged as a blue-collar town with a high crime rate and a gritty underbelly, dramatized by pop culture portrayals in series like ""The Wire"" and ""Serial,"" Baltimore today has a new sheen, transforming itself into a vibrant, culture-rich East Coast mainstay. And though it clings to its working-class roots, Baltimore   or ""Balmer"" as some residents say   also boasts contemporary museums, a sophisticated dining scene and a reimagined Inner Harbor that's luring art-loving types, outdoor enthusiasts and history buffs alike. This revitalized Charm City offers Yankee-Southern fusion architecture and a rich and eclectic culture, jam-packed with trendy art galleries, lively theaters and world-class collections at the Walters Art Museum and the Baltimore Museum of Art.  You can opt for a traditional Baltimore experience, filled with forays to historical sites like Fort McHenry National Monument, leisurely strolls along the Inner Harbor and Federal Hill Park and, of course, freshly caught blue crabs steamed and seasoned with a heavy dose of Old Bay. Or, if you've traveled to Charm City before, experience Baltimore's literary side with a trip to the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum before blending in with other baseball aficionados as you cheer on the Orioles at Camden Yards. And there's no way better to get a sense of Baltimore's quirky culture than at HonFest in June, when swarms of ladies sport leopard prints and sixties-era beehive hairstyles to support Baltimore's hard-working women.

It remains a defiant, working-class city tied to its nautical past, but in recent years has earned acclaim for impressive, up-to-the-minute entrepreneurial ventures, from new boutique hotels and edgy exhibits at world-class museums to forgotten neighborhoods now bustling with trendy food courts and farm-to-table restaurants. Traditionalists shouldn't worry, though   local culture and hometown sports, from lacrosse to baseball, remain part of the appeal.","The historic port city of neighborhoods Baltimore's claim-to-fame may be that it was the birthplace of America's National Anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" but its determined, down-to-earth spirit makes it a truly American city.

Case in point: Walk the city's brick-lined Freedom Trail to see landmarks that teleport you back to the Revolutionary War. But historic sites are just the start. Every neighborhood has its own vibe that's worth getting to know. Spend an afternoon in the North End, taste-testing cannoli from Italian-American bakeries. Or people-watch from a bench in Boston Common, which locals treat as an extension of their living room. It's worth taking the T out to neighboring Cambridge or Sommerville, especially during charming local festivals like What the Fluff, a festival dedicated to-what else?-marshmallow fluff.

Founded in 1630, its winding streets and stately architecture recall a legacy that is unmatched in the US, including key moments from the American Revolution, the abolition of slavery and the founding of the country’s first university, newspaper and labour union. But Boston’s notable past doesn’t mean that the city is backward looking. Quite the contrary, it remains pioneering in intellectual and entrepreneurial fields, its historic universities attracting the very best scientists, philosophers and writers from around the world. What’s more, the city continues to foster a rich cultural life, offering visitors a bewildering array of lectures, music gigs, poetry slam sessions and symphony concerts to choose from. Divided into distinct and characterful districts, Boston is a small city. It’s easy to walk around and public transport is extremely efficient. Begin at Boston Common, where you’ll find the tourist office and the start of the Freedom Trail. Rising above the Common is Beacon Hill, the city’s most historic and affluent neighborhood. To the east is Downtown with a mix of Colonial sights and high-rise, modern office blocks. North of Beacon Hill, across the broad Charles River lies pretty Cambridge, home to Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). To get an overview of the city ascend the Skywalk Observatory on the 50th floor of the towering Prudential building. From here you’ll be able to look out over the Harbor and to the islands beyond, where day-trippers escape to enjoy whale-watching cruises and lazy afternoons at one of the 30-odd islands in the bay. With its mix of cutting-edge museums and galleries; historic cultural sites; sophisticated restaurants and shopping; fantastic outdoor activities, from sailing in the bay to cycling the Charles River Cycle Path, Boston is an endlessly interesting, year-round destination. That said, the most popular time to visit is undoubtedly autumn, when the legendary New England foliage bursts into fiery colours.","Boston is one of North America's most beautiful cities, offering visitors a unique blend of historical sites and modern attractions, beautiful waterfront views and lush parks, wonderful hotels and restaurants, and more exciting events and things to do and see than you can possibly fit into one visit.

It's also home to America's first large free municipal public library, the first subway system, the first public school and the first public park. To say the city is historic would be an understatement, but this wicked smart college town doesn't linger in the past, either. A well-rounded trip to Boston integrates the classic with the contemporary: Split your time between cherished sites like the Paul Revere House and Faneuil Hall and modern attractions like the Museum of Fine Arts. Venture to Beacon Hill and you'll stumble upon the graceful mansions of yore juxtaposed with chic boutiques and innovative hotels. So, yes, come first for the history, but don't miss out on the opportunity to see the unmistakable Beantown flair.

Case in point: Walk the city's brick-lined Freedom Trail to see landmarks that teleport you back to the Revolutionary War. But historic sites are just the start. Every neighborhood has its own vibe that's worth getting to know. Spend an afternoon in the North End, taste-testing cannoli from Italian-American bakeries. Or people-watch from a bench in Boston Common, which locals treat as an extension of their living room. It's worth taking the T out to neighboring Cambridge or Sommerville, especially during charming local festivals like What the Fluff, a festival dedicated to-what else?-marshmallow fluff. Another outing that's a real classic: Fenway Park (watching a Red Sox game from the bleachers is a Boston rite of passage).

That Harbor, Those Islands As well as being the country's cleanest harbor, with the certification to prove it, Boston Harbor is the perfect spot for a sunset cruise.

Take the Harbor Express ferry to Spectacle Island or George Island from Long Wharf and then hop between other islands via water taxi. It's a Sports Fan's Paradise Catch the world-famous Boston Marathon on Patriot's Day. The race has taken place on the third Monday in April since 1897.

The Great Outdoors - Boston Style Frederick Law Olmsted was the brains behind the transformation of the swampy Charles River Basin into the city's most popular green space, the Charles River Reservation.

Founded in 1630, its winding streets and stately architecture recall a legacy that is unmatched in the US, including key moments from the American Revolution, the abolition of slavery and the founding of the country’s first university, newspaper and labour union. But Boston’s notable past doesn’t mean that the city is backward looking. Quite the contrary, it remains pioneering in intellectual and entrepreneurial fields, its historic universities attracting the very best scientists, philosophers and writers from around the world. What’s more, the city continues to foster a rich cultural life, offering visitors a bewildering array of lectures, music gigs, poetry slam sessions and symphony concerts to choose from. Divided into distinct and characterful districts, Boston is a small city. It’s easy to walk around and public transport is extremely efficient. Begin at Boston Common, where you’ll find the tourist office and the start of the Freedom Trail. Rising above the Common is Beacon Hill, the city’s most historic and affluent neighborhood. To the east is Downtown with a mix of Colonial sights and high-rise, modern office blocks. North of Beacon Hill, across the broad Charles River lies pretty Cambridge, home to Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). To get an overview of the city ascend the Skywalk Observatory on the 50th floor of the towering Prudential building. From here you’ll be able to look out over the Harbor and to the islands beyond, where day-trippers escape to enjoy whale-watching cruises and lazy afternoons at one of the 30-odd islands in the bay. With its mix of cutting-edge museums and galleries; historic cultural sites; sophisticated restaurants and shopping; fantastic outdoor activities, from sailing in the bay to cycling the Charles River Cycle Path, Boston is an endlessly interesting, year-round destination. That said, the most popular time to visit is undoubtedly autumn, when the legendary New England foliage bursts into fiery colours. Boston is one of North America's most beautiful cities, offering visitors a unique blend of historical sites and modern attractions, beautiful waterfront views and lush parks, wonderful hotels and restaurants, and more exciting events and things to do and see than you can possibly fit into one visit.

The perfect destination for history buffs, sports fanatics, beer drinkers, marathon runners, and academics. But what if we told you it's also the city for music lovers, foodies, outdoor enthusiasts, cultural travelers, and, truthfully, anyone!Discover history around every corner, award-winning restaurants, distinguished performance theaters, vast green spaces, endless family fun, and so much more. Step into history on the Freedom Trail, grab a lobster roll, visit our famous stadiums, or uncover the cultural diversity of 23 neighborhoods. No matter what's in your perfect itinerary, here's how to have a uniquely Boston experience. Boston is not only a hub for baseball, brownstones and bookish collegiate types. It's also home to America's first large free municipal public library, the first subway system, the first public school and the first public park. To say the city is historic would be an understatement, but this wicked smart college town doesn't linger in the past, either. A well-rounded trip to Boston integrates the classic with the contemporary: Split your time between cherished sites like the Paul Revere House and Faneuil Hall and modern attractions like the Museum of Fine Arts. Venture to Beacon Hill and you'll stumble upon the graceful mansions of yore juxtaposed with chic boutiques and innovative hotels. So, yes, come first for the history, but don't miss out on the opportunity to see the unmistakable Beantown flair.

Alongside abiding favorites and famous views — shopping on King Street, wandering down Rainbow Row, snagging a table at Fig or The Ordinary, venturing out to one of the nearby beaches — the city continuously boasts a variety of exciting openings and relative newcomers that quickly ingrain themselves in Charleston culture. Stop by Babas on Cannon for European-inspired dishes, an espresso, and maybe an aperitif or two. Classic southern Italian meets Lowcountry at Sorelle, an all-day restaurant, bar, and market spanning two stories of 88 Broad Street. Food tends to be a popular topic of conversation in Charleston, as the F&B scene is paramount for most visitors, but there's plenty to do in between meals. When you've reached the point where you can't fathom eating another bite, venture to neighboring Mount Pleasant, where you'll find a curation of local art at Charleston Artist Collective and a stellar sunset overlooking Charleston Harbor from Pitt Street Bridge. Centuries-old mansions, Spanish moss-draped trees, spooky cemeteries, cobblestone alleys: in a word, Charleston. As you walk the gas lamp-lit streets at night and pass horse-drawn carriages, you just might think you've traveled back in time.

Charleston boasts innovative restaurants, interesting shops, contemporary art galleries and the world-class Spoleto Festival USA.

History buffs can visit Fort Sumter to learn about the Civil War, Middleton Place to hear stories about the plantation owners and the enslaved Africans who worked for them, and Emanuel AME Church to see where Martin Luther King Jr. once delivered a historic speech. Meanwhile, shopaholics looking for locally made goods should peruse the Charleston City Market where they will find sweetgrass baskets woven in traditional Gullah design, among other unique souvenirs. When you're ready for a day at the beach, the city's got you covered there, too. Several neighboring beach towns, including Sullivan's Island, Isle of Palm and Folly Beach, offer sun, sand and gentle waves. Full of old-world charm, Charleston is a window into the nation's tumultuous past but also nourishes your mind, heart and stomach in roughly equal measure. Charleston Year-Round The Charleston area is a year-round feast for the senses. Spring smells like tea olive, summer is salty breezes, fall tastes like slow-cooked collard greens, and winter is a hearty bowl of shrimp and grits. While certain aspects of Lowcountry life are constant no matter what the time of year   the rustle of palmetto fronds, crashing surf and the peal of church bells   each season ushers in unique sensations. When azalea buds burst with color, spring is officially sprung and doors open at scores of private residences for the Historic Charleston Foundation's annual tour of houses and gardens. The sound of standing ovations says it's late spring, and Spoleto Festival USA and Piccolo Spoleto   the annual compendiums of acclaimed international and regional artists   enliven the area's theaters, churches, parks, galleries, sidewalks and event venues with 17 days of performances.  Sand between the toes means summer is in full swing, and family vacations are unfolding at area beaches. The scent of oysters roasting beneath wet burlap is synonymous with fall. Come during the Christmas season to experience some of the USA's most historic homes and beloved plantations illuminated with candlelight, starlight and the sounds of spiritual music.  No matter what the month, there's always something special waiting to be discovered.","Charleston,South Carolina"

104,Dallas,Texas,"With its towering skyscrapers and winding highways, Dallas is a big city that delivers on small-town charm. It's a place where luxury-brand boutiques are neighbors with local bootmakers, and saloons serve filet mignon and craft cocktails. Stroll through trendy Deep Ellum and catch some live music, or spend a day in the Arts District (the biggest one in the U.S.) and go museum-hopping. While the buildings themselves are a draw (check out the Reunion Tower for 360-degree views of the skyline), nature's everywhere, too. Hit the Katy Trail for a scenic walk through town, or head to the Dallas Arboretum to see the cherry blossoms do their thing in the spring. Yes, barbecue and Tex-Mex are big here (and shouldn't be missed), but there's also next-level Ethiopian food thanks to Dallas's thriving East African community. There's lots more to do and we've got recs, below.","Dallas is a city that rewards, welcomes, and entertains almost everyone who visits. There are few better places in America for sport lovers. If you love the NFL, watching the Cowboys is a must. But if you want to see something truly spectacular, Dallas is one of the few destinations where you can go to experience an authentic Rodeo. It's also a place to have a great night out. Dine on gourmet tacos and enchiladas at Desperados, Avila's, or Herrera's before heading for cocktails at popular spots like Windmill Lounge or the Porch. Add in more shopping malls than any other American city, an easy to navigate road network, and plenty of accommodation options, and you've got one of the hidden gems of American travel. The Dallas Cowboys The Cowboys might not be everyone's favorite team, but they usually put on a good show. Head to the AT&T Stadium to watch the five-time Superbowl winners in the NFC East. Shopping Malls Dallas is up there with New York and LA as a shopping destination, and in Dallas, shopping is all about hitting the malls. In fact, Dallas has the highest number of malls per capita in the country, including the luxury surroundings of Highland Park Village or the NorthPark Center, which also hosts the city's major art gallery. Rodeo Summertime in Dallas is Rodeo time. Between April and September, visitors can head to Mesquite Championship Rodeo or Plan Midnight Rodeo to watch the best cowboys in the business catch steers and ride bucking broncos. Tex-Mex Food Texan food is legendary and Dallas is the place to go for Tex-Mex dishes. Whether it's the tacos at Gonzales, the nachos and salsa at Urban Rio, or the enchiladas at Herrera's, the city is bursting with superb Mexican-influenced restaurants. History Dallas' main historical attraction is probably Deeley Plaza, the site of President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, but there's more to the town's history than that single shot. There are also pre-Civil War churches and homes at the Dallas Heritage Village and the beautiful 19th-century cathedral to explore.","As one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S., Dallas is starting to attract more and more visitors each year, making it number 14 on our list of top-visited cities in the country.  While the amazing Texas barbecue and Tex-Mex is a must-experience, Dallas is known for more than just its food.

There are many parks, biking and hiking trails, as well as the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens for locals and visitors alike to enjoy.

It's the city that gave the world Dynasty, Owen Wilson, LeAnn Rimes, the Super Bowl and the corndog – but all the same, there's more to Texas' most famous city than meets the eye. It might be synonymous with all things brash and bling but Big D, as the locals know it, has an unexpected erudite streak.  It's the place where the microchip was invented, the home of left-field R&B star Erykah Badu and is the birthplace of chili. No surprise then, that it has a pulsating art scene to rival that of Los Angeles, complete with enormous glow-in-the-dark frogs, and a surprisingly quirky selection of boutique bars. Of course that's not all. The city is dripping with petrodollars just as Dynasty portrayed it – and so, the shopping is high-end and will leave a sizeable dent in your wallet. Sport is still king, with the Dallas Cowboys NFL team drawing huge crowds each weekend, as do the Texas Rangers during the MLB baseball season. Nonetheless, you don't have to be a sports fan – or have a penchant for supersized servings of BBQ ribs – to love the US' ninth largest city. Spanning 28 hectares (68 acres) and 19 blocks, encompassed within the city limits is the Nasher Sculpture Center, complete with Miró and Matisse creations, the Winspear Opera House and the Texas-sized Museum of Art. Affluent Highland Park is the place to go for a Sue Ellen-style shopping trip, and along with big name brands such as Ralph Lauren, there are also boutiques showcasing the work of local designers such as Johnny Was and Sydney Evan to name but a few. Don't miss Wild Bill's Western Store – its custom made cowboy boots are not to be missed. Music fans should head to Deep Ellum, a gentrified former commercial area to the east of Downtown which is now the best place in Dallas to hear jazz and blues. Further afield is Fort Worth, Dallas' sister city – and the place to go for all things Western. There's even a bar, Billy Bob's, with a rodeo set up inside.","From the classics like Reunion Tower and Perot Museum of Nature and Science, to new experiences in must-see spots like Trinity Groves and the Design District, there are endless ways to fill a trip to Dallas. Throughout Dallas, you'll find plenty of ways to fill a one, two, or even three-day trip to Dallas with performances, restaurants, and adventures. Check out the nation's largest urban arts district, world-class shopping and accommodations, the mouth-watering cuisine from countless restaurants and eateries, beautiful green spaces, outdoor trails, and live entertainment in our distinct neighborhoods, each with their own compelling vibe.","All eyes were on Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as his motorcade drove through Dealey Plaza. While a visit to this famous site, which also serves as the birthplace of Dallas, should be at the top of every traveler's must-see list, that's not all the Big D has to offer visitors. Those in search of family-friendly to-dos should add the Dallas World Aquarium, the Dallas Zoo and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science to their itineraries, while culture hounds explore the Dallas Art Museum, Deep Ellum and the Crow Museum of Asian Art.  If you're looking for a quintessentially Texan experience, Dallas offers that too. Whether you're in town for a Dallas Cowboys home game at AT&T Stadium, the annual State Fair of Texas, or simply hoping to enjoy some tasty barbecue or Tex-Mex, you'll find it all in Dallas.","Dallas, the 'Big D', is Texas' most mythologized city, rich in the stuff of which American legends are woven. For a time, the eponymous TV series Dallas served to define the USA to the world, while the Cowboys and their cheerleaders remain iconic. Unlike many Texan cities, Dallas has avoided the boom-and-bust cycle of the oil industry, to the point where this is the country's fastest-growing metropolitan area. There's money here a-plenty, and conspicuous consumption is very much the norm.","Experiences live up to a big reputation Dallas is a city rich in culture, history and culinary experiences as well as unique surprises. It's home to the world-famous Dallas Cowboys, spectacular dining and entertainment, and shopping that will keep you busy for days. It's the city where Southern hospitality meets a Texas twist. Only in Dallas Start with the true Texas experience at the Texas Horse Park. It's less than 13 kilometers from downtown, but you'd never know it from the park's serene horseback trails. For the sports fan, head west for a VIP guided tour at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys professional football team.  For a historic experience, visit The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza to walk through a timeline of John F. Kennedy's life and presidency. You can also explore the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, go inside the president's decision-making process in the interactive Decision Points Theater and take a photo behind the president's desk in a full-sized replica of the Oval Office.  For a different view of Dallas, head to the Reunion Tower GeO-Deck. The observation deck   170 meters in the sky   includes an outdoor walkway. Science lovers should stop by the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, home to one of the most impressive gem collections in the USA as well as a recently discovered dinosaur species only available for viewing in Dallas.  An added bonus: The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, Reunion Tower GeO-Deck and Perot Museum of Nature and Science are CityPASS attractions. With the Dallas CityPASS, you can save 40 percent on admission to four top Dallas attractions.     Shopping, Dallas-Style No visit to Dallas is complete without a shopping spree. Step into historic West End for souvenirs at Wild Bill's Western Store. For an upscale experience at one of the country's most renowned shopping centers, go to NorthPark Center and take advantage of the tax-free shopping available to international visitors.     A Taste of Dallas No matter the taste, Dallas delivers. Trinity Groves, a trendy food mecca just west of downtown, features everything from barbecue, sushi and Spanish tapas to Southern comfort food and burgers. Deep Ellum offers bites of delicious Texas barbecue while Tex-Mex favorite restaurants like Meso Maya give you margaritas in every option   savory or sweet, frozen or on the rocks; two may be in order if you can't decide.     Explore Like A Local Make your way to Klyde Warren Park, where locals and visitors alike join in fun activities like tai chi and chess on the Great Lawn. More into people watching? Grab a patio seat at Savor Gastropub in the heart of the park.

It's a place where luxury-brand boutiques are neighbors with local bootmakers, and saloons serve filet mignon and craft cocktails. Stroll through trendy Deep Ellum and catch some live music, or spend a day in the Arts District (the biggest one in the U.S.) and go museum-hopping. While the buildings themselves are a draw (check out the Reunion Tower for 360-degree views of the skyline), nature's everywhere, too. Hit the Katy Trail for a scenic walk through town, or head to the Dallas Arboretum to see the cherry blossoms do their thing in the spring. Yes, barbecue and Tex-Mex are big here (and shouldn't be missed), but there's also next-level Ethiopian food thanks to Dallas's thriving East African community. There's lots more to do and we've got recs, below. Dallas is a city that rewards, welcomes, and entertains almost everyone who visits. There are few better places in America for sport lovers. If you love the NFL, watching the Cowboys is a must. But if you want to see something truly spectacular, Dallas is one of the few destinations where you can go to experience an authentic Rodeo. It's also a place to have a great night out. Dine on gourmet tacos and enchiladas at Desperados, Avila's, or Herrera's before heading for cocktails at popular spots like Windmill Lounge or the Porch. Add in more shopping malls than any other American city, an easy to navigate road network, and plenty of accommodation options, and you've got one of the hidden gems of American travel. The Dallas Cowboys The Cowboys might not be everyone's favorite team, but they usually put on a good show. Head to the AT&T Stadium to watch the five-time Superbowl winners in the NFC East. Shopping Malls Dallas is up there with New York and LA as a shopping destination, and in Dallas, shopping is all about hitting the malls. In fact, Dallas has the highest number of malls per capita in the country, including the luxury surroundings of Highland Park Village or the NorthPark Center, which also hosts the city's major art gallery. Rodeo Summertime in Dallas is Rodeo time. Between April and September, visitors can head to Mesquite Championship Rodeo or Plan Midnight Rodeo to watch the best cowboys in the business catch steers and ride bucking broncos. Tex-Mex Food Texan food is legendary and Dallas is the place to go for Tex-Mex dishes. Whether it's the tacos at Gonzales, the nachos and salsa at Urban Rio, or the enchiladas at Herrera's, the city is bursting with superb Mexican-influenced restaurants. History Dallas' main historical attraction is probably Deeley Plaza, the site of President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, but there's more to the town's history than that single shot. There are also pre-Civil War churches and homes at the Dallas Heritage Village and the beautiful 19th-century cathedral to explore. As one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S., Dallas is starting to attract more and more visitors each year, making it number 14 on our list of top-visited cities in the country.  While the amazing Texas barbecue and Tex-Mex is a must-experience, Dallas is known for more than just its food. Sports teams like the Dallas Cowboys, a bustling art scene and the Texas State Fair attract visitors from all over each year.  There are many parks, biking and hiking trails, as well as the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens for locals and visitors alike to enjoy.

It's the city that gave the world Dynasty, Owen Wilson, LeAnn Rimes, the Super Bowl and the corndog – but all the same, there's more to Texas' most famous city than meets the eye. It might be synonymous with all things brash and bling but Big D, as the locals know it, has an unexpected erudite streak.  It's the place where the microchip was invented, the home of left-field R&B star Erykah Badu and is the birthplace of chili. No surprise then, that it has a pulsating art scene to rival that of Los Angeles, complete with enormous glow-in-the-dark frogs, and a surprisingly quirky selection of boutique bars. Of course that's not all. The city is dripping with petrodollars just as Dynasty portrayed it – and so, the shopping is high-end and will leave a sizeable dent in your wallet. Sport is still king, with the Dallas Cowboys NFL team drawing huge crowds each weekend, as do the Texas Rangers during the MLB baseball season. Nonetheless, you don't have to be a sports fan – or have a penchant for supersized servings of BBQ ribs – to love the US' ninth largest city. Spanning 28 hectares (68 acres) and 19 blocks, encompassed within the city limits is the Nasher Sculpture Center, complete with Miró and Matisse creations, the Winspear Opera House and the Texas-sized Museum of Art. Affluent Highland Park is the place to go for a Sue Ellen-style shopping trip, and along with big name brands such as Ralph Lauren, there are also boutiques showcasing the work of local designers such as Johnny Was and Sydney Evan to name but a few. Don't miss Wild Bill's Western Store – its custom made cowboy boots are not to be missed. Music fans should head to Deep Ellum, a gentrified former commercial area to the east of Downtown which is now the best place in Dallas to hear jazz and blues. Further afield is Fort Worth, Dallas' sister city – and the place to go for all things Western. There's even a bar, Billy Bob's, with a rodeo set up inside. From the classics like Reunion Tower and Perot Museum of Nature and Science, to new experiences in must-see spots like Trinity Groves and the Design District, there are endless ways to fill a trip to Dallas. Throughout Dallas, you'll find plenty of ways to fill a one, two, or even three-day trip to Dallas with performances, restaurants, and adventures. Check out the nation's largest urban arts district, world-class shopping and accommodations, the mouth-watering cuisine from countless restaurants and eateries, beautiful green spaces, outdoor trails, and live entertainment in our distinct neighborhoods, each with their own compelling vibe. All eyes were on Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as his motorcade drove through Dealey Plaza. While a visit to this famous site, which also serves as the birthplace of Dallas, should be at the top of every traveler's must-see list, that's not all the Big D has to offer visitors. Those in search of family-friendly to-dos should add the Dallas World Aquarium, the Dallas Zoo and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science to their itineraries, while culture hounds explore the Dallas Art Museum, Deep Ellum and the Crow Museum of Asian Art.  If you're looking for a quintessentially Texan experience, Dallas offers that too. Whether you're in town for a Dallas Cowboys home game at AT&T Stadium, the annual State Fair of Texas, or simply hoping to enjoy some tasty barbecue or Tex-Mex, you'll find it all in Dallas. Dallas, the 'Big D', is Texas' most mythologized city, rich in the stuff of which American legends are woven. For a time, the eponymous TV series Dallas served to define the USA to the world, while the Cowboys and their cheerleaders remain iconic. Unlike many Texan cities, Dallas has avoided the boom-and-bust cycle of the oil industry, to the point where this is the country's fastest-growing metropolitan area. There's money here a-plenty, and conspicuous consumption is very much the norm. Experiences live up to a big reputation Dallas is a city rich in culture, history and culinary experiences as well as unique surprises. It's home to the world-famous Dallas Cowboys, spectacular dining and entertainment, and shopping that will keep you busy for days. It's the city where Southern hospitality meets a Texas twist. Only in Dallas Start with the true Texas experience at the Texas Horse Park. It's less than 13 kilometers from downtown, but you'd never know it from the park's serene horseback trails. For the sports fan, head west for a VIP guided tour at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys professional football team.  For a historic experience, visit The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza to walk through a timeline of John F. Kennedy's life and presidency. You can also explore the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, go inside the president's decision-making process in the interactive Decision Points Theater and take a photo behind the president's desk in a full-sized replica of the Oval Office.  For a different view of Dallas, head to the Reunion Tower GeO-Deck. The observation deck   170 meters in the sky   includes an outdoor walkway. Science lovers should stop by the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, home to one of the most impressive gem collections in the USA as well as a recently discovered dinosaur species only available for viewing in Dallas.  An added bonus: The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, Reunion Tower GeO-Deck and Perot Museum of Nature and Science are CityPASS attractions. With the Dallas CityPASS, you can save 40 percent on admission to four top Dallas attractions.     Shopping, Dallas-Style No visit to Dallas is complete without a shopping spree. Step into historic West End for souvenirs at Wild Bill's Western Store. For an upscale experience at one of the country's most renowned shopping centers, go to NorthPark Center and take advantage of the tax-free shopping available to international visitors.     A Taste of Dallas No matter the taste, Dallas delivers. Trinity Groves, a trendy food mecca just west of downtown, features everything from barbecue, sushi and Spanish tapas to Southern comfort food and burgers. Deep Ellum offers bites of delicious Texas barbecue while Tex-Mex favorite restaurants like Meso Maya give you margaritas in every option   savory or sweet, frozen or on the rocks; two may be in order if you can't decide.     Explore Like A Local Make your way to Klyde Warren Park, where locals and visitors alike join in fun activities like tai chi and chess on the Great Lawn. More into people watching? Grab a patio seat at Savor Gastropub in the heart of the park. Music lovers will be entertained at the AT&T Performing Arts Center with a night of performances at the Wyly Theatre or Winspear Opera House, or melodious music at the Meyerson Symphony Center.

Ultimately, deep veins of silver and other metals were found up in the mountains and Denver was able to establish itself as a supply town and eventually as a place for the new millionaires to invest in grand homes and the arts. As Denver endured many boom-and-bust cycles over the years, new generations saw fresh appeal and made the city more alluring.

Detroit is not unfamiliar with change and reinvention, and yet for all its complexity, the Motor City is often primarily thought of as the land of automobiles. While this is undeniably a piece of Detroit's fascinating narrative, the city has a great deal more to offer, particularly in the creative arts, which have long played a prominent role in Detroit's past (from original urban murals to an iconic record label), and in continuing to shape the ever-changing city today. Museums like MOCAD share the work of brilliant Detroit artists with natives and visitors alike, while also making the case that Detroit is a destination for a diverse, international range of art.

3545,Fort Lauderdale,Florida,"Despite its mostly after-hours draw for Spring Breakers and party-goers, Fort Lauderdale has a lot to offer before happy hour: miles of golden beaches, rare coral reefs, and a culture all its own. Thanks to the canals that connect the city, its other rep as the ""Venice of America"" means you can kayak, paddleboard, and even ride a gondola to get around. There's lots of great stuff by land, too: picnic in Hugh Taylor Birch State Park (Fort Lauderdale's own Central Park), grab some sand at LGBTQ+-friendly Sebastian Street Beach, or check out the 1920's artists' home-turned-museum Bonnet House & Gardens. By sundown, head toward the hum of Las Olas Boulevard for dinner, drinks, and dancing-we've got travelers' favorite spots and even more recs below.","Sun, sea, sand and a terrific climate. Fort Lauderdale lies right at the heart of Florida's spectacular Gold Coast and its white sandy beaches far surpass those of its more famous neighbor, Miami. Fort Lauderdale's extensive canal system has earned the city the nickname, the ""Venice of America"". The town and ocean are linked to the Everglades and South Florida by the Intracoastal Waterway. It's easy to reach Fort Lauderdale from anywhere in the US by road, sea or air and the sunny weather means that almost any time is perfect for a long vacation or a short city break. Add glittering nightlife and entertainment, beautiful parks, outstanding shopping malls and friendly locals, and you can easily see why Fort Lauderdale is well worth a visit. Beach Life Visitors are often struck by how calm and uncrowded Fort Lauderdale Beach is in comparison to Miami. You'll find the same crystal clear waters and pristine white sand but without the crowds. If you'd prefer a more secluded beach, nearby Hillsboro and Dania beaches both offer a relaxed atmosphere and stunning views. Dinner at Cap's Back in the 1920's when Captain Theodore Knight, aka Cap, established his business, it was a secret spot where members could gamble. During the Prohibition period, he smuggled alcohol to his Hillsboro Inlet joint from the Bahamas by boat. Always popular with notable public figures and celebrities, Cap's has been visited by FDR, JFK and Winston Churchill. Boat is still the only way to reach the city's oldest restaurant - be sure to try hearts of palm salad made with Sabal Palm grown by a Native American family in the Everglades. Cruise the Intracoastal Discover the city's famous canal system by water taxi. Marvel at the spectacular mansions that line the canals, many of them owned by celebrities and top athletes. Tickets are $22 for adults and $11 for children and are valid for one day. Hop on and off at any of the 19 stops close to local attractions like Las Olas Boulevard. Sail the High Seas Once you've explored the Intracoastal and canals, why not head for the open ocean? Fort Lauderdale is the yachting capital of America and charters like Spirit of Lauderdale can be booked at the marina. Try a spot of sea fishing or look for dolphins frolicking closer to the shore. It's a Top Gay Vacation Destination Once a spring break destination, Fort Lauderdale now attracts a more stylish crowd. The city welcomes thousands of gay vacationers each year; it's home to the largest Metropolitan Community Church in the US and boasts four great gay-friendly beaches.","If you're in need of some vitamin sea, look no further than Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which ranks number 10 for top travel destinations in the U.S.  Beaches, art, entertainment and events are among Fort Lauderdale's most well-known draws. The ""Venice of America"" offers everything from gondola rides on the canals to shopping on Las Olas Boulevard alongside a picturesque riverfront.  While the city's historic and arts districts make for great land activities, Fort Lauderdale is known for its water activities, like snorkeling and boat cruises, for a prime view of the mansions and yachts dotting Millionaires' Row.

You can judge if they're right, but certainly expect a different atmosphere than their close rival Miami Beach. Fort Lauderdale's wide stretches of white sand surpass those of its southern neighbor and, to some, are the best shores statewide. And when you consider its fantastic scenery, great dining options and range of things to do, Fort Lauderdale is also somewhat affordable compared to similar vacation spots. The ""Venice of America,"" nicknamed for its 165 miles of waterways and canals, is slowly but surely climbing the ranks of top beach destinations to the cheer of its residents.","After years of building a reputation as the destination for beer-swilling college students on raucous spring breaks, Fort Lauderdale now angles for a slightly more mature and sophisticated crowd. Think martinis rather than tequila shots; jazz concerts instead of wet T-shirt contests. But don't worry, there's still plenty of carrying-on within the confines of area bars and nightclubs.  Best for tantalizing beaches and boating Blessed with an impressive stretch of white-sand beaches and seemingly endless canals, Fort Lauderdale is heralded as the yachting capital of the world and ""The Venice of America"". Its annual boat show, held in October, is the world's largest in-water boating show. Stroll the famous Riverwalk, stop for a beer at the legendary Elbo Room, watch mermaids perform at America's only underwater burlesque show, or shop and dine along famous Las Olas Boulevard.","A relaxed beachside metropolis with culture and canals Catering to travelers who want to experience its laid-back but refined seaside culture and beautiful scenery, the Greater Fort Lauderdale area welcomes visitors from around the world.

On the wilder side, watch for alligators as you ride along the famed ""River of Grass"" in the Everglades. Visit the world's largest butterfly garden and hummingbird aviary at Butterfly World. Join a guided nighttime turtle walk to spy some hatchlings as they scurry out to sea. Get around by hopping on the Water Taxi, which includes New River, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Whistle Stop routes. Two sightseeing excursions   Jungle Queen or Riverfront Cruises   expand on the water fun and the area's extensive canals.     Entertainment, Dining & Shopping Head to Gulfstream Park, home to the world-renowned Pegasus Cup, as well as tons of shopping and dining options.

Thanks to the canals that connect the city, its other rep as the ""Venice of America"" means you can kayak, paddleboard, and even ride a gondola to get around. There's lots of great stuff by land, too: picnic in Hugh Taylor Birch State Park (Fort Lauderdale's own Central Park), grab some sand at LGBTQ+-friendly Sebastian Street Beach, or check out the 1920's artists' home-turned-museum Bonnet House & Gardens. By sundown, head toward the hum of Las Olas Boulevard for dinner, drinks, and dancing-we've got travelers' favorite spots and even more recs below. Sun, sea, sand and a terrific climate. Fort Lauderdale lies right at the heart of Florida's spectacular Gold Coast and its white sandy beaches far surpass those of its more famous neighbor, Miami. Fort Lauderdale's extensive canal system has earned the city the nickname, the ""Venice of America"". The town and ocean are linked to the Everglades and South Florida by the Intracoastal Waterway. It's easy to reach Fort Lauderdale from anywhere in the US by road, sea or air and the sunny weather means that almost any time is perfect for a long vacation or a short city break. Add glittering nightlife and entertainment, beautiful parks, outstanding shopping malls and friendly locals, and you can easily see why Fort Lauderdale is well worth a visit. Beach Life Visitors are often struck by how calm and uncrowded Fort Lauderdale Beach is in comparison to Miami. You'll find the same crystal clear waters and pristine white sand but without the crowds. If you'd prefer a more secluded beach, nearby Hillsboro and Dania beaches both offer a relaxed atmosphere and stunning views. Dinner at Cap's Back in the 1920's when Captain Theodore Knight, aka Cap, established his business, it was a secret spot where members could gamble. During the Prohibition period, he smuggled alcohol to his Hillsboro Inlet joint from the Bahamas by boat. Always popular with notable public figures and celebrities, Cap's has been visited by FDR, JFK and Winston Churchill. Boat is still the only way to reach the city's oldest restaurant - be sure to try hearts of palm salad made with Sabal Palm grown by a Native American family in the Everglades. Cruise the Intracoastal Discover the city's famous canal system by water taxi. Marvel at the spectacular mansions that line the canals, many of them owned by celebrities and top athletes. Tickets are $22 for adults and $11 for children and are valid for one day. Hop on and off at any of the 19 stops close to local attractions like Las Olas Boulevard. Sail the High Seas Once you've explored the Intracoastal and canals, why not head for the open ocean? Fort Lauderdale is the yachting capital of America and charters like Spirit of Lauderdale can be booked at the marina. Try a spot of sea fishing or look for dolphins frolicking closer to the shore.

After years of building a reputation as the destination for beer-swilling college students on raucous spring breaks, Fort Lauderdale now angles for a slightly more mature and sophisticated crowd.

Attractions in Jax, as the locals call it, range from art, science and history museums to a brewery tour, from the Jacksonville Landing entertainment complex, along the St. John's River, to Bronson Motor Speedway. The city's beaches offer soft sand and warm water perfect for swimming, surfing and kayaking. Northern Florida's largest city, Jacksonville (or ""Jax"") is a beach resort, family vacation destination, sporting center, and cultural hub all rolled into one. If you want to get away to the sunshine and have museums, galleries, and shopping opportunities on your doorstep, it's a great place to visit. There are bohemian boutiques and a buzzing craft ale scene in 5 Points, gourmet eateries in genteel San Marco, and the chance to lose yourself in the gorgeous gardens of the Cummer Museum. With the endless sands of Jacksonville Beach and Ponte Vedra a short drive away, Jacksonville is fast becoming one of America's most attractive urban destinations. The Endless Sands of Jacksonville's Beaches Jacksonville may be a big city, but you can easily escape the high-rises of the city center to beaches as appealing as any in northern Florida. Hop on the Beaches Trolley to visit Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and the historic fishing village of Mayport, and be back at your hotel in the evening. Elite Sports, from the Jaguars to TPC Sawgrass Sports lovers flock to Jacksonville. For some, the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars are the biggest draw, while in golf, the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass is one of the biggest events of the year. Fantastic Zoos, Galleries, and Museums Jacksonville has plenty for a rainy day as well. The Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens and the Museum of Contemporary Art will satisfy art lovers, while MOSH (the Museum of Science and History) and Jacksonville Zoo are great child-friendly attractions. Southern Home Cooking, Welcoming Pubs, and Outdoor Food Markets There aren't many better places to enjoy traditional southern cooking or seafood than Jax. In March, the Seafood Festival showcases the city's best shrimp and fish restaurants, while all year-round, soul food specialists like Soul Food Express and the Potters House serve up collard greens and fried chicken to match anywhere in the USA. Jazz, Blues, and Rock Festivals Throughout the Year If you love music, Jacksonville always has something to offer. Spring sees the city hosting its Springing the Blues Festival, the Jacksonville Jazz Festival rolls into town over Memorial Day weekend, while Rockville attracts thousands of fans in April.

It's a great place to enjoy the Florida sunshine while touring the eco-friendly city via bike, scooter, skateboard or foot. You can also head to the wetlands for a kayaking trip in the Amelia Island area.  Jacksonville is a special place to visit because of its delicious cuisine, flourishing craft beer culture and diverse nightlife.

Yes, we have 22 miles of beaches, year-round sunshine, world-class museums and all the extras you'd expect from a city our size, but Jacksonville offers a different take on the basics. We're a little bit country, and a whole lot of (Southern) rock n' roll.  Throw a dart on a map of Florida, and you'll likely land on a pretty beach, a theme park, a golf course, or a crystal-blue pool. But if you're open to something a little different, you'll find a slice of Florida that locals love. Don't worry, you're not flipping out. You've just never been to Jacksonville — the Flip Side of Florida. Flip what you know about Florida. Busy beaches and theme parks? That's further south. We're talkin' a different style of Sunshine state of mind. Think manatees, not mermaids. More magnolias than palm trees. Less shuffleboard, more surfboards. World-class golf greens, and delicious collards. A hot bar scene, and even hotter sandbars. Don't worry, you're not flipping out. Enjoy our 22 miles of beaches, extensive park system, world-class fishing, historic neighborhoods, family adventures, eclectic museums, vibrant street arts scene, creative coastal cuisine, delicious craft beer and so much more! While Jacksonville isn't your typical Florida vacation destination   and it may not be your first choice when planning your trip to the Sunshine State   the city just might surprise you. Many travelers visit this expansive city to attend major sporting events, concerts and other live performances or hop on a cruise to the Bahamas. But Jacksonville does have the makings of a great getaway. There are more than 1,100 miles of navigable waterways in Jacksonville, which is more shoreline than any other U.S. city, and there are 22 miles of beaches. Just outside the city, in Jacksonville's Northside, there are also beautiful unspoiled barrier islands with white-sand beaches, such as Boneyard Beach, Little Talbot Island, Blackrock Beach and Huguenot Park.  Jacksonville was ranked as one of the major ""Boomtowns"" during the COVID-19 pandemic (based on a study by LendingTree) and it's among the top 20 best places to live. The biggest boost of all to the River City is the proposed $2 billion downtown revitalization project, one of the largest urban core revitalizations in the U.S., which will bring interconnected, walkable neighborhoods and many new public spaces. Today, Jacksonville continues to flourish as a business center, though it doesn't draw the crowds of the state's other tourism hot spots   just yet. Now's the time to experience downtown's Tudor, Victorian and Jacobethan Revival mansions, cool neighborhoods and unique Old Florida charm without paying the overwhelming rates associated with better-known tourism destinations.  Urban buzz, outdoor fun and beaches aplenty Jacksonville is Florida's natural water wonderland. The abundant waterways, parks and ecological preserves provide opportunities to escape the ordinary and relax in nature's playground. The city has the largest urban park system in the nation with more than 80,000 acres as well as more than 35 kilometers of unspoiled, white-sand beaches. All this natural beauty is surrounded by a modern and vibrant city   the largest by landmass in the nation   filled with authentic dining options, thrilling attractions, world-class museums, beautiful hotels, exciting events, cool nightlife, a hip downtown and unique districts complete with Southern hospitality. From unspoiled beaches to the exciting Intracoastal Waterway and the sparkling St. Johns River, water defines this ""River City by the Sea.""

386,Las Vegas,Nevada,"Whatever you can dream up, Las Vegas delivers: Michelin-starred restaurants, 24-hour wedding chapels, larger-than-life scenery, slot machines, all of it. But just when you think you have Vegas pinned down, it surprises you. Consider Meow Wolf, an immersive experience that's equal parts theme park and art gallery. Or the ice rink at the Cosmopolitan (winter in the desert!). And then there's the nature-head out past the Strip, and you'll find state parks and views for days in spots like Valley of Fire and Red Rock Canyon. It's gems like these that round out Vegas as a destination for families and non-partiers too.","When Mormon pioneers established a fort in the middle of a punishing Mojave Desert landscape in the 1850s, only two short decades after the United States had annexed the area from Mexico, no one could have forecast that it would become a neon-festooned symbol of American ingenuity, capitalism, and round-the-clock fun. Yet here we are. What once was a dusty pit stop between California and Utah now attracts more than 40 million conventioneers and pleasure seekers a year. Las Vegas is the most unlikely of American cities. Ancient hunter-gatherers originally populated this area, and throughout the decades, Spanish merchants, pioneers, railroaders, Mafia crime bosses, and multi-billion-dollar gaming corporations have made their mark. Today it is a high-budget entertainment zone with over 4,000 restaurants—the highest per capita density of any US city—a packed and growing Strip of hotels; multiple mega sports arenas, and, thanks to savvy marketing, is one of the most recognizable brands on the planet.","Las Vegas, marketed as the Entertainment Capital of the World, ranks number three on our list of most visited cities in the U.S. Due to the popularity of legalized gambling, alcoholic beverages accessible at any time and various forms and degrees of adult entertainment, Las Vegas is famously known as Sin City.   While the world-famous casinos and clubs will excite any socialite, Las Vegas offers plenty more to suit people of all ages and interests.

Nowhere throws a party quite like Vegas, which has long been known as a centre of decadence that gives plenty of bang for your buck. But in recent years, it has been developing more of a luxury feel, with world-class restaurants and more elegant hotels cropping up. As a fantasy-island escape from the ‘real world’, the self-styled city (out on its own near Nevada’s southern tip) is almost beyond comparison. The electric frenzy of The Strip flows through the centre of an adult playground of epic proportions. Since gambling was introduced here in the 1930s, Las Vegas has gone through several phases to reach today’s realm of sprawling hotel-casino complexes crowding the skyline. Classier options have emerged in the city of late, with a slew of Michelin-starred gourmet restaurants opening in place of the former all-you-can-eat buffets. There are also several glamorous international hotel chains competing to attract wealthier jetsetters, making some of the older dens of iniquity look a little tacky and out-dated. The largest, most famous hotel-casinos are worlds unto themselves with gambling, accommodation, shopping, dining, circuses, and theme parks all rolled into one. When cut loose in one of these self-contained emporiums, visiting rookies can lose all sense of time and space. It might be midnight or midday – the party doesn’t stop. Complimentary drinks are offered to gamblers, and the roulette wheel spins from dusk ’til dawn. There’s invariably a group of stragglers or early risers propping up the bar, while cabaret performances and clubs run late into the night. However, there’s more to the city than hedonistic nightclubs and blackjack tables. Venture away from The Strip, and Vegas hosts top-notch art galleries, heritage museums and jaw-dropping nature.

Spend the day admiring marine life at the Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino or strap in for the 108-story controlled free fall at SkyJump at The STRAT Hotel, Casino & Tower. The ideal spot to catch your breath is the three-level Chandelier Bar at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, offering signature drinks and its own multi-story visual spectacle. You can test the waters at the festive LIQUID Pool Lounge at ARIA Resort & Casino, or for a more relaxing sojourn, take tea at the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas Tea Lounge high above the Strip. End your evening with a meal and a great view at Lakeside at Wynn Las Vegas.     Beyond Las Vegas Boulevard Off the Strip, an equal amount of fun awaits. Head over to Downtown Las Vegas and try the SlotZilla zip lines under the Viva Vision video canopy of the Fremont Street Experience. Passengers on the upper line ""fly"" over all the excitement of Fremont Street below. Besides the shops, dazzling lights and nightly shows, Circa Resort & Casino features Stadium Swim. The heated pool amphitheater, open throughout the four seasons, offers visitors a fabulous dip while catching the biggest sporting events on a massive, 143-foot screen. Other Downtown Las Vegas favorites include LONGBAR at The D Las Vegas, the intimate Downtown Cocktail Room, the lively feel of the Commonwealth and the Downtown Container Park. Back closer to the Strip, you'll find live music at The Front Yard at Ellis Island Hotel, Casino & Brewery. Southern hospitality and cuisine await at The Orleans Hotel and Casino, while The Oyster Bar at Palace Station Hotel Casino serves up live-action seafood prepared before your eyes available 24/7.     Nature and Culture Take a break from the bright lights and visit nearby Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area for hiking, biking and climbing adventures, and then unwind with a spa treatment at Red Rock Casino Resort Spa. Las Vegas offers access to whitewater rafting at the Grand Canyon and year-round golf and dune buggy tours through sand dunes. Check out The Neon Museum to tour the signs that once adorned Las Vegas hotels and casinos.

100,Miami,Florida,"Miami at night is legendary-it's all art-deco neon, music spilling into the streets and rooftop cocktails. But by day, there's just as much to explore. Architecture buffs can visit the reconstructed 12th century Ancient Spanish Monastery and Renaissance-inspired Vizcaya Museum & Gardens, or cruise down the art deco-dotted Ocean Drive. For beach lovers, there's plenty beyond South Beach: Swim with sea turtles at Boynton Beach, go windsurfing at Hobie Beach, or skip the sand and take a dip at the Venetian Pool (another architectural gem). And thanks to the strong Cuban and Jewish communities, you can snack on pastelitos in Little Havana or grab a loaf of kosher rye in Wynwood-in the same day, if you're up for it.","Miami: a colorful trip into the heart of Latin America, without a passport Just over a century ago, Miami was little more than a tiny fishing outpost at the end of an uninhabitable swamp. To say it's grown up quickly would be an understatement, as it's transformed from a far-flung vacation destination to a major global metropolis.","Miami, the center of southern Florida, comes in at number 15 on our list of the top places visited in the United States. Miami has a vibe unlike any other city in the state of Florida.  A few of the distinctive features that make Miami one of the best cities in the U.S. include the Cuban influence along Calle Ocho in Little Havana, the Art Deco District in Miami Beach that evokes the 1930s era and the summertime beach scene of South Beach.  Miami is full of culture and has great nightlife, but to finish off your trip, you must see Miami's skyline from a boat on the water.  Featured deals and activities:  Speedboat Sightseeing Tour of Miami Parasailing with Miami Watersports Superblue Miami Immersive Art Experience Ticket in Miami Miami Millionaire's Row Cruise Jet Ski Rentals in Miami","Famed for its tropical climate, Hispanic culture and Art Deco seafront, Miami has the glamour to rival LA but offsets any glitz with a gritty urban edge. Dominated by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and its tended golden beaches, the city may seem brash at first but it has much more to offer than bling, beach babes and celebrity fans. Its eclectic architecture should present clues as to its cultural and historical depth. Just look at its diverse neighbourhoods: Downtown Miami is a place of gleaming glass and steel skyscrapers, while Little Havana is home to a thriving Cuban community. The salty Port of Miami, meanwhile, is unlike either. This is where cargo ships and Navy destroyers moor alongside gargantuan cruise ships en route to the Caribbean. Miami Beach is famous for its glittering strip of vast hotels, palatial homes and glamorous locals. The surrounding showy neighbourhood of South Beach is instantly recognisable with its candy-coloured buildings set against a pure South Florida backdrop of cloudless skies, dazzling blue ocean, pale sandy beaches and swaying palm trees. The city is swiftly becoming a hub for culture too. The Wynwood Arts District and Miami Design District are a case in point, as is the Biscayne Bay museum quarter. Frank Gehry’s New World Center is a spectacular example of post-modernist design, while the wonderful Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) is alluring on a smaller scale. There is no shortage of things to do outside Miami either. If the beaches lose their appeal, head west to the Everglades, a sprawling flooded wetland which is home to thousands of wild alligators. Further up the coast is Fort Lauderdale, with its Venice-inspired canals and vast cruise terminal, while to the south is the wonderfully bohemian Florida Keys (or The Conch Republic as it is known to some independently-minded locals). So, whether you are exploring the city centre or relaxing in the sunny suburbs, Miami is one city that never gets boring.","The Miami you think you know—the one flush with mojitos, exotic cars, and neon string bikinis—still thrives in pockets of South Beach. But that image doesn't fully capture the reality, the diversity or the soul of the city. Across the causeway, a new cosmopolitanism hub has sprouted in once-gritty Wynwood and the business hub of Brickell. Calle Ocho thrums with energy. And even the beachy side of the Miami continues to grow and change.  From the sizzling nightlife of South Beach to the authentic Cuban flavors of Little Havana, Miami offers one of the richest cultural experiences of any city in the United States. Its diverse neighborhoods house everything from world-famous street art to world-class restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, and cultural venues. Miami's colorful history is matched only by the vibrancy and verve of the modern global city it's continually blossoming into today.  Miami has attracted the world's most daring and creative minds since its evolution from native Tequesta lands to the promising new frontier of railroad tycoon Henry Flagler in the late 1800s. A developing father of Florida, Flagler expanded his Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896 and the rest, as they say, is history.  Today, Miami is a destination for lovers of art, design, food, shopping, and even the great outdoors.  You'll discover so many exciting things to do in Greater Miami & Miami Beach, whether you want to dive into the area's arts and culture scene, explore national parks, or take a fun sightseeing tour. Here's just a sampling of the many vacation attractions and activities you can enjoy in Miami. Miami offers outdoor adventurers an array of exciting opportunities, both in the water and on land. Kayak, canoe or stand-up paddle board at Oleta River State Park the Deering Estate or Crandon Park. Take a boat ride through Biscayne National Park 95% percent of which is underwater. It's part of the Florida Reef, the only living coral barrier reef in the United States and one of the largest reefs in the world. Experience Miami's unique wilderness with hikes, scenic drives and guided tours in Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve. At Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, stroll amid rare palms, aromatic fruits and the vibrant blooms of flowering trees. Art galleries, museums and stunning street art are some of the best things to see in Miami. Explore the arts and culture scene as you spend an afternoon at The Bass, the P¨¦rez Art Museum Miami (PAMM) or the Wynwood Walls. Admire the architecture in South Beach's Art Deco District on a walking tour with the Miami Design Preservation League. Zoo Miami, the Venetian Pool and the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science are some of the many fun things to do in Miami with kids. For an adventure geared toward adults, spend an afternoon sipping wine and beer made with local tropical fruits at Schnebly Redland's Winery & Brewery. Indulge yourself in luxury with a day of pampering at one of Miami's chic spas or stroll through the stores at Aventura Mall, Brickell City Centre, Dadeland Mall and Bal Harbour Shops.","Take a number of diverse cultures, add a strong dose of the arts and a splash of ocean water, and you have Miami. Looking at the fantastic art museums and the blossoming gastronomical scene, you might find it hard to believe that just a century ago, this colorful Floridian city was covered in swampland. Once developers rushed into the area, one of the most popular tourist destinations and spectacular city skylines in the country was born. Today, with South Beach before you and the Everglades behind you, you can walk through the bustling streets past historical homes with Spanish words and Caribbean music floating into your ears.  This mini melting pot has preserved multicultural neighborhoods like famous Little Havana as enclaves for unique traditions to thrive. United, they form an electric network   Miami. Its reputation for vibrant nightlife and extravagant parties is realized in Miami Beach, a barrier island to the east of the mainland. Meanwhile, the down-to-earth city proper cultivates an artsy vibe. For a taste of Miami Beach, sign up for one of the city's best boat tours, where you'll be able to marvel at the glitzy skyline from the water on a boat tour or via parasail.","Beautiful beaches and art deco delights are just some of Miami's many charms, but don't forget the blazing nightlife, tropical gardens, a lively arts scene and sizzling cuisine.

But by day, there's just as much to explore. Architecture buffs can visit the reconstructed 12th century Ancient Spanish Monastery and Renaissance-inspired Vizcaya Museum & Gardens, or cruise down the art deco-dotted Ocean Drive. For beach lovers, there's plenty beyond South Beach: Swim with sea turtles at Boynton Beach, go windsurfing at Hobie Beach, or skip the sand and take a dip at the Venetian Pool (another architectural gem). And thanks to the strong Cuban and Jewish communities, you can snack on pastelitos in Little Havana or grab a loaf of kosher rye in Wynwood-in the same day, if you're up for it. Miami: a colorful trip into the heart of Latin America, without a passport Just over a century ago, Miami was little more than a tiny fishing outpost at the end of an uninhabitable swamp. To say it's grown up quickly would be an understatement, as it's transformed from a far-flung vacation destination to a major global metropolis. Miami, the center of southern Florida, comes in at number 15 on our list of the top places visited in the United States. Miami has a vibe unlike any other city in the state of Florida.  A few of the distinctive features that make Miami one of the best cities in the U.S. include the Cuban influence along Calle Ocho in Little Havana, the Art Deco District in Miami Beach that evokes the 1930s era and the summertime beach scene of South Beach.  Miami is full of culture and has great nightlife, but to finish off your trip, you must see Miami's skyline from a boat on the water.  Featured deals and activities:  Speedboat Sightseeing Tour of Miami Parasailing with Miami Watersports Superblue Miami Immersive Art Experience Ticket in Miami Miami Millionaire's Row Cruise Jet Ski Rentals in Miami Famed for its tropical climate, Hispanic culture and Art Deco seafront, Miami has the glamour to rival LA but offsets any glitz with a gritty urban edge. Dominated by its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and its tended golden beaches, the city may seem brash at first but it has much more to offer than bling, beach babes and celebrity fans. Its eclectic architecture should present clues as to its cultural and historical depth. Just look at its diverse neighbourhoods: Downtown Miami is a place of gleaming glass and steel skyscrapers, while Little Havana is home to a thriving Cuban community. The salty Port of Miami, meanwhile, is unlike either. This is where cargo ships and Navy destroyers moor alongside gargantuan cruise ships en route to the Caribbean. Miami Beach is famous for its glittering strip of vast hotels, palatial homes and glamorous locals. The surrounding showy neighbourhood of South Beach is instantly recognisable with its candy-coloured buildings set against a pure South Florida backdrop of cloudless skies, dazzling blue ocean, pale sandy beaches and swaying palm trees. The city is swiftly becoming a hub for culture too. The Wynwood Arts District and Miami Design District are a case in point, as is the Biscayne Bay museum quarter. Frank Gehry’s New World Center is a spectacular example of post-modernist design, while the wonderful Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) is alluring on a smaller scale. There is no shortage of things to do outside Miami either. If the beaches lose their appeal, head west to the Everglades, a sprawling flooded wetland which is home to thousands of wild alligators. Further up the coast is Fort Lauderdale, with its Venice-inspired canals and vast cruise terminal, while to the south is the wonderfully bohemian Florida Keys (or The Conch Republic as it is known to some independently-minded locals). So, whether you are exploring the city centre or relaxing in the sunny suburbs, Miami is one city that never gets boring. The Miami you think you know—the one flush with mojitos, exotic cars, and neon string bikinis—still thrives in pockets of South Beach. But that image doesn't fully capture the reality, the diversity or the soul of the city. Across the causeway, a new cosmopolitanism hub has sprouted in once-gritty Wynwood and the business hub of Brickell. Calle Ocho thrums with energy. And even the beachy side of the Miami continues to grow and change.  From the sizzling nightlife of South Beach to the authentic Cuban flavors of Little Havana, Miami offers one of the richest cultural experiences of any city in the United States. Its diverse neighborhoods house everything from world-famous street art to world-class restaurants, hotels, shopping centers, and cultural venues. Miami's colorful history is matched only by the vibrancy and verve of the modern global city it's continually blossoming into today.  Miami has attracted the world's most daring and creative minds since its evolution from native Tequesta lands to the promising new frontier of railroad tycoon Henry Flagler in the late 1800s. A developing father of Florida, Flagler expanded his Florida East Coast Railway to Miami in 1896 and the rest, as they say, is history.  Today, Miami is a destination for lovers of art, design, food, shopping, and even the great outdoors.  You'll discover so many exciting things to do in Greater Miami & Miami Beach, whether you want to dive into the area's arts and culture scene, explore national parks, or take a fun sightseeing tour.

For an adventure geared toward adults, spend an afternoon sipping wine and beer made with local tropical fruits at Schnebly Redland's Winery & Brewery. Indulge yourself in luxury with a day of pampering at one of Miami's chic spas or stroll through the stores at Aventura Mall, Brickell City Centre, Dadeland Mall and Bal Harbour Shops. Take a number of diverse cultures, add a strong dose of the arts and a splash of ocean water, and you have Miami. Looking at the fantastic art museums and the blossoming gastronomical scene, you might find it hard to believe that just a century ago, this colorful Floridian city was covered in swampland. Once developers rushed into the area, one of the most popular tourist destinations and spectacular city skylines in the country was born. Today, with South Beach before you and the Everglades behind you, you can walk through the bustling streets past historical homes with Spanish words and Caribbean music floating into your ears.  This mini melting pot has preserved multicultural neighborhoods like famous Little Havana as enclaves for unique traditions to thrive. United, they form an electric network   Miami. Its reputation for vibrant nightlife and extravagant parties is realized in Miami Beach, a barrier island to the east of the mainland. Meanwhile, the down-to-earth city proper cultivates an artsy vibe. For a taste of Miami Beach, sign up for one of the city's best boat tours, where you'll be able to marvel at the glitzy skyline from the water on a boat tour or via parasail.

286,Minneapolis,Minnesota,"With its gleaming skyscrapers set amid glittering lakes, Minneapolis makes for an attractive and fun getaway. A truly year-round destination, the city offers activities for every season. In winter, one can explore the downtown area through more than seven miles of glass-enclosed skyways. In addition to keeping you warm, they create a lively thoroughfare filled with specialty shops, restaurants and services. Whether you want to escape the winter cold or the summer warmth, the Mall of America offers shopping, dining and entertainment options for any time of the year and every member of the family.

With kids in tow, check out the Science Museum of Minnesota, where visitors can produce their own video, or come face to face with a shark at the UnderWater Adventures Aquarium. In summer, the action moves outside. Known as ""The City of Lakes,"" Minneapolis has 22 lakes located within city limits and many more in the surrounding area. In town, hordes of locals and tourists in-line skate or stroll around Lake Calhoun, stopping for ice cream along the way. Just outside of town, Fort Snelling State Park offers outdoor recreational activities from hiking to biking and golf to boating. No matter when you visit, Minneapolis offers lots for everyone to enjoy.","Minneapolis A.K.A Waterfall City, is a city of great food, sporting attractions, natural beauty, and cultural delights. In fact, it's the pearl of the north, and a destination that's easy to fall for. If if not the the cheesy Juicy Lucy burgers you become obsessed with, it might be the local beers from the Surly Brewing Co, it could be restaurants on Eat Street or the magical art collection at the Walker Art Center. Whatever it is that draws people in, Minneapolis is a city that keeps people coming back for more. While it's not huge (around 400,000 people in all), this is a city with heart and soul. You can feel it at Target Field as the Twins get ready to bat. You can sense it in the parks and at the markets of Downtown. Minneapolis is special, and it could well be the ideal city break destination for you. Food and Drink If you love food, you'll love Minneapolis. From the Vietnamese, Chinese and German eateries of Eat Street to the daily farmers' market to the Greek and Scandinavian restaurants in North Minneapolis, dining out is a treat. And don't forget to try local delicacies like the cheese-filled Juicy Lucy burgers. Sport The Minnesota Twins are one of Major League Baseball's most popular teams, and Target Field is a fantastic place to visit. If the baseball season has ended, there's also the chance to watch the Vikings battle it out in the NFC North. Art Minneapolis is one of the north's cultural centers, with great theaters and music venues to explore. However, it's art that really shines in the Twin Cities. In the Walker Art Center, you'll find one of America's leading contemporary art collections, while places like the Soap Factory and All My Relations offer cutting edge work from the area's many local artists.

No other city offers so many beautiful spots within walking distance of the center. Shopping Minneapolis is also a shopping center. In the middle of town, there are plenty of malls, not least the Nicollet Mall, which offers dining options and major brands to choose from. However, it's dwarfed by the Mall of America - the largest mall in the USA and a truly awesome experience. You won't even scratch the surface of what it has to offer in one visit, so set aside a couple of days to visit all of its wings and attractions.","If the idea of a city weekend getaway doesn't make you think of Minneapolis, Minnesota, you aren't alone, but you must not be familiar with the City of Lakes. The fact that Minneapolis is a hub for arts and culture is what surprises people the most about its style and personality. The late Minnesotan rock singer, Prince, may have been the largest proponent of Minneapolis tourism.  With Minneapolis becoming one of the top travel destinations in the U.S., this hidden gem of a city is becoming more prevalent.

These two urban areas may be joined at the hip, but they are far from identical. With its striking contemporary buildings, Minneapolis is the more modern and cosmopolitan sister. St Paul, with its 19th- and early 20th-century buildings, is more refined, in the manner you'd expect from a place that doubles as the Minnesota state capital. Both cities are multicultural melting pots, with significant Hmong and Somali populations. And both are rich in arts and culture, and in all of North America, only New York entertains more theatregoers each year. One top venue is the Guthrie Theater, home to Shakespearean productions and experimental plays, while the Hennepin Theatre District features music and comedy. Elsewhere, the modern works displayed in the Walker Art Center are worth anyone's time. Also in Minneapolis, the Mill City Museum commemorates the Twin Cities' role as the centre of American flour production in the 19th century, while across the river, the marble dome of the State Capitol building soars proudly over St. Paul. In addition to the Mississippi, this is a place with no fewer than 949 lakes lying within its metropolitan area, so it's no surprise that outdoor recreation plays an important role. One popular excursion is a ride along the river aboard the Minneapolis Queen paddle-wheeler. Back on dry land, the Mall of America draws in 40 million bargain hunters every year, and is said to be the busiest shopping mall in the world. At night, Minneapolis' Warehouse District is the place to head, not only for a pre-theatre dinner, but also for a chic cocktail, and is also home to several energetic nightclubs. Elsewhere, the centre is filled with trendy cafés and bistros, while starched linen and crystal glasses are the order of the day across in St. Paul. With so much diversity on offer, everyone is sure to find something to their liking.","The state capital, St. Paul, and neighboring Minneapolis make up the Twin Cities, an incredibly rich and diverse area with dramatic skylines, exciting pro sports, award-winning theater, renowned restaurants and a booming craft beer scene.  Revel in the natural beauty of dozens of trails, parks and waterways, such as the Chain of Lakes and the Mississippi River. You can also shop 'til you drop at local boutiques and the nation's largest mall, Mall of America, with no tax on clothing or shoes. Or, attend one of the hundreds of annual events in the region, from small-town celebrations to one of the largest state fairs in the country.","In the last half of the 20th century, famed architects like Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron and Frank Gehry transformed the quiet Midwestern farming cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul into a booming cultural metropolis, complete with the contemporary Walker Art Center and the Weisman Art Museum. Minneapolis and St. Paul's artistic, architectural and theatrical renaissance has made this region of the Midwest culturally fertile. Case in point: Check out the cities' innovative live music and nightlife scenes, which once nurtured the careers of greats like Prince and Bob Dylan.  Joined by roughly 10 miles of urban sprawl, these fraternal twin cities were named as such to remind outsiders looking in of their differences. Originally, Irish and German immigrants built St. Paul, while Scandinavians settled in Minneapolis. St. Paulites hold tight to their heritage, continuing architectural styles and beer brewing traditions. However, the Minneapolitans proudly favor modern progress. Residents are quick to distinguish the two, but visitors usually find it difficult. The buildings act as good markers of distinction: Minneapolis is cutting-edge, tall and modern; St. Paul is short, historical and modest. The contrast (and competition) only enhances the character of this coupled metropolitan area.","Minneapolis is the biggest and artsiest town on the prairie, with all the trimmings of progressive prosperity   swank art museums, rowdy rock clubs, organic and ethnic eateries, and edgy theaters. It's always happenin', even in winter. And here's the bonus: folks are attitude-free and the embodiment of 'Minnesota Nice.' Count how many times they tell you to 'Have a great day,' come rain, shine or snow.","A mix of urban sophistication and outdoor action Imagine a city where you can step out of your hotel and into a kayak, right into the Mighty Mississippi River, where Stone Arch Bridge and St. Anthony Falls will take your breath away; where you can watch a ball game at Target Field, one of the best baseball stadiums in America, then take in a touring Broadway show; and where you can give your credit cards a workout at all sorts of shops and your taste buds a massage with award-winning cuisine. That city is Minneapolis, a mix of urban sophistication and outdoor action. Good Sports Several professional teams   baseball's Twins, football's Vikings, women's basketball's Lynx, men's basketball's Timberwolves and hockey's Wild   in addition to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers are all based in Minneapolis. Several major venues drawing enthusiastic fans no matter the season include the U.S. Bank Stadium, home of the xGames in 2017 and 2018, Super Bowl LII in 2018, and the Final Four tournament of NCAA men's collegiate basketball in 2019.     Arts and Theater The Walker Art Center, the most-visited modern art museum in the United States, displays an extensive collection across all disciplines, as well as live performances, lectures and movies. Outside New York City, Minneapolis has the most live theaters per capita. Catch a show at the Tony Award-winning Guthrie Theater, a Broadway production at the Orpheum Theatre, or a concert at the Minnesota Orchestra or Minnesota Opera.

In addition to the Mississippi, this is a place with no fewer than 949 lakes lying within its metropolitan area, so it's no surprise that outdoor recreation plays an important role. One popular excursion is a ride along the river aboard the Minneapolis Queen paddle-wheeler. Back on dry land, the Mall of America draws in 40 million bargain hunters every year, and is said to be the busiest shopping mall in the world. At night, Minneapolis' Warehouse District is the place to head, not only for a pre-theatre dinner, but also for a chic cocktail, and is also home to several energetic nightclubs. Elsewhere, the centre is filled with trendy cafés and bistros, while starched linen and crystal glasses are the order of the day across in St. Paul. With so much diversity on offer, everyone is sure to find something to their liking. The state capital, St. Paul, and neighboring Minneapolis make up the Twin Cities, an incredibly rich and diverse area with dramatic skylines, exciting pro sports, award-winning theater, renowned restaurants and a booming craft beer scene.  Revel in the natural beauty of dozens of trails, parks and waterways, such as the Chain of Lakes and the Mississippi River. You can also shop 'til you drop at local boutiques and the nation's largest mall, Mall of America, with no tax on clothing or shoes. Or, attend one of the hundreds of annual events in the region, from small-town celebrations to one of the largest state fairs in the country. In the last half of the 20th century, famed architects like Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron and Frank Gehry transformed the quiet Midwestern farming cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul into a booming cultural metropolis, complete with the contemporary Walker Art Center and the Weisman Art Museum. Minneapolis and St. Paul's artistic, architectural and theatrical renaissance has made this region of the Midwest culturally fertile. Case in point: Check out the cities' innovative live music and nightlife scenes, which once nurtured the careers of greats like Prince and Bob Dylan.  Joined by roughly 10 miles of urban sprawl, these fraternal twin cities were named as such to remind outsiders looking in of their differences. Originally, Irish and German immigrants built St. Paul, while Scandinavians settled in Minneapolis. St. Paulites hold tight to their heritage, continuing architectural styles and beer brewing traditions. However, the Minneapolitans proudly favor modern progress. Residents are quick to distinguish the two, but visitors usually find it difficult. The buildings act as good markers of distinction: Minneapolis is cutting-edge, tall and modern; St. Paul is short, historical and modest. The contrast (and competition) only enhances the character of this coupled metropolitan area. Minneapolis is the biggest and artsiest town on the prairie, with all the trimmings of progressive prosperity   swank art museums, rowdy rock clubs, organic and ethnic eateries, and edgy theaters. It's always happenin', even in winter. And here's the bonus: folks are attitude-free and the embodiment of 'Minnesota Nice.' Count how many times they tell you to 'Have a great day,' come rain, shine or snow. A mix of urban sophistication and outdoor action Imagine a city where you can step out of your hotel and into a kayak, right into the Mighty Mississippi River, where Stone Arch Bridge and St. Anthony Falls will take your breath away; where you can watch a ball game at Target Field, one of the best baseball stadiums in America, then take in a touring Broadway show; and where you can give your credit cards a workout at all sorts of shops and your taste buds a massage with award-winning cuisine. That city is Minneapolis, a mix of urban sophistication and outdoor action. Good Sports Several professional teams   baseball's Twins, football's Vikings, women's basketball's Lynx, men's basketball's Timberwolves and hockey's Wild   in addition to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers are all based in Minneapolis. Several major venues drawing enthusiastic fans no matter the season include the U.S. Bank Stadium, home of the xGames in 2017 and 2018, Super Bowl LII in 2018, and the Final Four tournament of NCAA men's collegiate basketball in 2019.     Arts and Theater The Walker Art Center, the most-visited modern art museum in the United States, displays an extensive collection across all disciplines, as well as live performances, lectures and movies. Outside New York City, Minneapolis has the most live theaters per capita. Catch a show at the Tony Award-winning Guthrie Theater, a Broadway production at the Orpheum Theatre, or a concert at the Minnesota Orchestra or Minnesota Opera. Visit Mill City Museum, an old flour mill on the Mississippi Riverfront, for a look into the city's past. At the Minneapolis Institute of Art, view 40,000-year-old artifacts alongside modern masterpieces.     City of Fitness and Nature Minneapolis has been hailed the Fittest City in America, the Healthiest City in America, the best parks system in the U.S., one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world (321 kilometers of trails, to be exact) and the sixth-best U.S. city for runners. Explore more than 320 kilometers of recreation trails. Play and relax at one of 197 parks. Enjoy fishing, canoeing, boating and ice sports in the popular Chain of Lakes.     Eat, Drink and Shop The Mall of America is the largest shopping mall in the country.

Taste the creative craft brews from the city's dozens of breweries. According to Yelp data, Minneapolis ranks first in the USA for the number of breweries per capita. Sample the unique flavors at Pizzeria Lola, ranked 18th best in the world, Vietnamese dishes from Lotus, Latin cornmeal cakes from Hola Arepa and handmade pastries at Patisserie 46.","Minneapolis,Minnesota"

Its restaurants are first class, its art scene is blossoming and it even has a replica of Greece's Parthenon as an art museum. So what are you waiting for?

But off the main drag, you'll also find quirky cafes and fancy antique shops, must-visit museums and haunted cemeteries. Hop on the St. Charles Streetcar and take in the Garden District's antebellum mansions, or spend an afternoon in the eclectic Bywater, where you can restaurant hop along St. Claude Avenue and see contemporary art at Studio Be.

If you love to eat, you can feast on the gourmet seafood at the Acme Oyster House (724 Iberville St) and wash it down with a Sazerac cocktail at the Carousel Bar (214 Royal St), or head to Willie Mae's Scotch House (2401 St Ann St) for some authentic southern soul food. Wherever you go, New Orleans has something to delight the senses _ so make it your next American destination. Mardi Gras Mardi Gras is world-famous for its energy, color, and good-time atmosphere. This street festival is one of the greatest sights (and sounds) that American life has to offer, with live music, dazzling parades, and parties all-night-long. Head to the city in late February or early March (the date shifts) to enjoy the fun. Music Many people visit New Orleans for one thing only _ to listen to music in the birthplace of jazz. On any night of the week, you can hear virtuoso jazz and blues musicians at venues like the Spotted Cat (623 Frenchmen St) or Snug Harbor (626 Frenchmen St). The Architecture By American standards, New Orleans is ancient, having been founded in 1718. Its rich history of French, Spanish, and American rule has left a legacy of extraordinary buildings. Wander down Bourbon Street, see the Cabildo, or the red-brick beauty of the Pontalba Buildings (1008 N Peters St). Food Cajun cooking is another global export that New Orleans is proud of. During your visit, you can feast on Jambalaya at Gumbo Shop (630 St Peter St) or fresh crawfish at Bevi Seafood Co.

It’s a little bit French, a little bit Spanish-Creole, a little bit Caribbean and a whole lot New Orleans – there’s nowhere quite like it, even in the American South. Tucked between the Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain, New Orleans sprawls across low-lying swampland, with the floodwaters held at bay by enormous levees, which broke with devastating consequences in 2005 as Hurricane Katrina surged ashore. The good news is that many neighbourhoods have burst back to life, and little evidence of the disaster remains in the areas most frequented by tourists - though deprivation and crime still blight live in some quarters of the city (most notably the Ninth Ward). Known as the Crescent City for the curving shape of the Mississippi as it snakes through town, New Orleans is truly cosmopolitan. Settlers from as far afield as France, Spain, Africa and the Caribbean washed up here during New Orleans’ heyday as the principal port of the American South. Each group lent something to the mixing pot. The French left their language, and the Spanish their flamboyant architecture. Africa donated the rhythms that morphed into jazz and the blues. The Caribbean left a love of celebration and a touch of voodoo magic, while Cajun Americans pulled all these influences together to create one of America’s most eclectic cuisines. The attractions of New Orleans are the same as they have always been – riding rattling streetcars and the Algiers ferry, snapping your fingers to hot jazz in colonial cafes, seeking out occult relics in ancient cemeteries, or just admiring the stately architecture in the French Quarter, Bywater, Faubourg Marigny and Tremé. Then of course there’s the greatest-show-on-earth that is Mardi Gras, held in late February or early March. If you miss it, don’t panic; there are few weeks in the year when there isn’t some festival or other filling the streets with crowds and music. As the locals say: “Laissez les bons temps rouler!” (“Let the good times roll!”).","Whether this is your first time to New Orleans or you're a seasoned visitor, the city's invigorating spirit is sure to inspire, captivate and motivate you to jump in and see and do so much.  With so many options and many things to do all the time, narrowing the playing field can be a challenge.  Think of it this way: divide how much time you have by what your priorities are   history, art, music, culture, and on and on - and then add in a little time for the spontaneous joy that is the Crescent City's calling card. Subtract a few hours for sleep, multiply your dining pleasure by at least three times a day, and you have the perfect equation for an amazing New Orleans experience. New Orleans is an over-the-top experience for the senses, a city filled with vibrantly colored streets, soul-filled rhythm and blues, and memorable flavors. The coastal Louisiana enclave is the culinary heart of creole and cajun food, and beyond delicacies from gumbo to shrimp and grits, it's the city that brought us the muffuletta, beignets, and char-broiled oysters.  New Orleans, nicknamed ""The Big Easy,"" is a town of jazz kings and queens, iconic architecture, the New Orleans Saints, and perhaps the most spirited street in America—Bourbon Street. It's also one of the only cities in America where you can legally drink on the street, which only adds to the lively nature of NOLA nightlife. Comedian and actor Hannibal Burress famously said of the Big Easy that ""for $300 you can have your own parade on a day's notice,"" and if that doesn't beautifully encapsulate the glory of New Orleans in one sentence, we don't know what does.  For legendary New Orleans jazz, the best restaurants in New Orleans, and every other must-try activity, including tours of the bayou and ghost tours of the city's most haunted streets, consult this guide. We've mapped out exactly what to do in New Orleans to experience this renowned city of celebration and resilience. It's so easy to blow it—to never leave the French Quarter or end up in a Yelp-recommended jazz club on Bourbon Street that's packed with tourists wearing Mardi Gras beads no matter the time of year. The biggest problem you'll have here is that there's way too much to eat, drink, and see in this city to waste any meal, cocktail, or hours between lunch and dinner. What follows is our guide to never feeling like a tourist in a town crawling with them.","New Orleans is known for its European-style architecture, mouthwatering Creole cuisine and all-around good-time vibes. Considered the birthplace of jazz, the city oozes music from every crevice, whether it's blues, rock 'n' roll or zydeco. Music plays a key role in the backbone and spirit of New Orleans. While most people travel to the Southern city for Mardi Gras, a Carnival-type event that features masks, music, floats and merriment, that's not the only party New Orleans hosts. Travelers will find plenty of events and festivals to attend year-round.   Post-Hurricane Katrina, the city has had its share of environmental disasters, such as the BP oil spill and Hurricane Isaac, which made the rebuilding of New Orleans challenging, but the city has persevered. Over the past several years, major efforts have been made to restore the distinct districts. Today, Crescent City looks almost as good as new. Start your visit with a walking tour through the French Quarter, where colonial heritage and ghost lore still survive. From here, you can explore the major architectural sites before enjoying a hearty plate of jambalaya and a rowdy evening out.  The city is also home to a bustling port. In fact, New Orleans is the sixth-largest cruise port in the U.S. Cruisers can travel to Mexico, the Caribbean or along the Mississppi River to Memphis, Tennessee, on a river cruise.","With a vivacious community spirit and deep-rooted cultural fusion, New Orleans breathes the things that make life worth living: eating, drinking and celebrating.","It's easy to love and hard to leave the Big Easy No matter the time of year, New Orleans welcomes its visitors in a grand way to experience Caribbean, Spanish, French and African cultures colliding in a brilliant explosion of flavors, emotions and sounds. Music is everywhere, people live to eat and every day is a party here in the birthplace of jazz, which is also home to Creole cuisine, centuries-old Spanish oak trees and clacking streetcars. With a unique combination of city life, swamp tours, festivals, historical significance and revelry during Mardi Gras, New Orleans has the recipe to captivate everyone. Absorbing History and Architecture Hop on the St. Charles Avenue, Canal Street or Riverfront streetcars to explore the more than 300-year-old city that is split by the Mississippi River and surrounded by lakes, bayous and bays. Admire the architecture in over 20 historic districts, more than any other city in the USA. See mansions on St. Charles Avenue, opulent estates in the Garden District and a revolving carousel bar at Hotel Monteleone. In the heart of the French Quarter, you'll want to linger in lively Jackson Square. After admiring artists' work hanging on the iron fence and, perhaps, getting your fortune told, cross the street to visit the 18th century St. Louis Cathedral, the USA's oldest continually operating cathedral. For a different perspective, tour the area aboard the Natchez steamboat or the Creole Queen paddle wheeler.     Eating Your Way Through the City To fuel all that sightseeing, make a pit stop at the French Market for a cup of caf¨¦ au lait paired with a beignet, or get a cold drink on Bourbon Street. Plot your course for the rest of the day, ensuring you'll have a chance to sample signature foods, including gumbo, jambalaya, po'boy sandwiches, boiled crawfish and charbroiled oysters. The city's restaurants, and chefs, consistently earn spots on lists ranking the best places to eat in the USA.     Tuning in to Music A music lovers' paradise that's home to Jazz, Zydeco, R&B and Soul, New Orleans has produced its share of musical giants, from greats like Louis Armstrong to contemporary acts like Trombone Shorty, Jon Batiste, Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr. Explore Frenchmen Street in the Faubourg Marigny, an original Creole neighborhood that's a mecca for nightclubs, bars and restaurants. Live music occurs every day and night of the year, and many venues feature award-winning performers throughout the week. A must-stop is Preservation Hall, dedicated to preserving the New Orleans Jazz tradition.     The Fun, Funky and Enlightening Also worthy of your time are visits to the National World War II Museum and the Presbytere and Cabildo state museums. Learn about voodoo traditions at shops and museums dotting the city. Dive into the history of Mardi Gras and see how its famous parade floats are made at Mardi Gras World. Take part in New Orleans cocktail culture with a visit to The Sazerac House, which is dedicated to the USA's original cocktail, the Sazerac. See something you like while exploring? Buy it.

For some, it's all about Bourbon Street, a never-ending street party fueled by daiquiris and brass-band beats. But off the main drag, you'll also find quirky cafes and fancy antique shops, must-visit museums and haunted cemeteries. Hop on the St. Charles Streetcar and take in the Garden District's antebellum mansions, or spend an afternoon in the eclectic Bywater, where you can restaurant hop along St. Claude Avenue and see contemporary art at Studio Be. Good music is everywhere-in Frenchmen Street's jazz clubs, Uptown's dive bars, Treme's lounges, and on nearly every street corner. While Cajun and Creole dishes remain the city's most iconic, there's also very good Vietnamese food, from traditional pho to banh mi po'boys. And that's just for starters-find even more recs below. Nowhere else on earth is quite like the Big Easy. Situated at the mouth of the Mississippi, New Orleans is the home of jazz and blues, Cajun cooking, and the spectacular colors and parades of Mardi Gras. If you love a good time, there's no better destination. Spend your evenings on bar hopping Bourbon or Frenchmen Street hopping from bar to bar, catching some of America's most talented musicians. Head to Treme to watch blues bands light up the local clubs, or find a spot in Jackson Square and watch the street performers. If you love to eat, you can feast on the gourmet seafood at the Acme Oyster House (724 Iberville St) and wash it down with a Sazerac cocktail at the Carousel Bar (214 Royal St), or head to Willie Mae's Scotch House (2401 St Ann St) for some authentic southern soul food. Wherever you go, New Orleans has something to delight the senses _ so make it your next American destination. Mardi Gras Mardi Gras is world-famous for its energy, color, and good-time atmosphere. This street festival is one of the greatest sights (and sounds) that American life has to offer, with live music, dazzling parades, and parties all-night-long. Head to the city in late February or early March (the date shifts) to enjoy the fun. Music Many people visit New Orleans for one thing only _ to listen to music in the birthplace of jazz. On any night of the week, you can hear virtuoso jazz and blues musicians at venues like the Spotted Cat (623 Frenchmen St) or Snug Harbor (626 Frenchmen St). The Architecture By American standards, New Orleans is ancient, having been founded in 1718. Its rich history of French, Spanish, and American rule has left a legacy of extraordinary buildings. Wander down Bourbon Street, see the Cabildo, or the red-brick beauty of the Pontalba Buildings (1008 N Peters St). Food Cajun cooking is another global export that New Orleans is proud of. During your visit, you can feast on Jambalaya at Gumbo Shop (630 St Peter St) or fresh crawfish at Bevi Seafood Co. (4701 Airline Drive); and when Mardi Gras is in full swing, don't miss the spectacular king cake at Willa Jean (611 Okeefe Ave). The Nightlife New Orleans doesn't like to sleep making it one of America's premier nightlife destinations. You can listen to twenty bands a night on Bourbon Street, gamble at Harrah's Casino (8 Canal Street), or dive into all-night dance clubs like Beach on Bourbon (227 Bourbon Street). No other Southern city compares to New Orleans, Louisiana. The cultural fusion, which is heavily influenced by French and Spanish, is more reminiscent of the Caribbean than the United States.   This city is unique because of its Cajun and Creole food, jazz and French Quarter architecture. With a variety of lavish resorts and accommodations, New Orleans is the ideal location for a long weekend escape.  Mardi Gras, when extravagant costumes and floats light up the streets, music can be heard everywhere and the celebrations appear never-ending, is the climax of New Orleans' calendar year. If crowds aren't your thing, you can head out of town on an airboat ride through the swamp or take a tour of the Oak Alley Plantation.  Featured deals and activities:  New Orleans Airboat Ride New Orleans Haunted Ghost, Voodoo, Vampire and Mystery Tour Haunted Pub Crawl in New Orleans New Orleans Steamboat Natchez Harbor Cruise New Orleans Original Flavors Food Tour of the French Quarter Bon appetit Sitting pretty at the mouth of the Mississippi River, New Orleans is one of America’s most astonishing cultural melting pots. It’s a little bit French, a little bit Spanish-Creole, a little bit Caribbean and a whole lot New Orleans – there’s nowhere quite like it, even in the American South. Tucked between the Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain, New Orleans sprawls across low-lying swampland, with the floodwaters held at bay by enormous levees, which broke with devastating consequences in 2005 as Hurricane Katrina surged ashore. The good news is that many neighbourhoods have burst back to life, and little evidence of the disaster remains in the areas most frequented by tourists - though deprivation and crime still blight live in some quarters of the city (most notably the Ninth Ward). Known as the Crescent City for the curving shape of the Mississippi as it snakes through town, New Orleans is truly cosmopolitan. Settlers from as far afield as France, Spain, Africa and the Caribbean washed up here during New Orleans’ heyday as the principal port of the American South. Each group lent something to the mixing pot. The French left their language, and the Spanish their flamboyant architecture. Africa donated the rhythms that morphed into jazz and the blues. The Caribbean left a love of celebration and a touch of voodoo magic, while Cajun Americans pulled all these influences together to create one of America’s most eclectic cuisines. The attractions of New Orleans are the same as they have always been – riding rattling streetcars and the Algiers ferry, snapping your fingers to hot jazz in colonial cafes, seeking out occult relics in ancient cemeteries, or just admiring the stately architecture in the French Quarter, Bywater, Faubourg Marigny and Tremé. Then of course there’s the greatest-show-on-earth that is Mardi Gras, held in late February or early March. If you miss it, don’t panic; there are few weeks in the year when there isn’t some festival or other filling the streets with crowds and music. As the locals say: “Laissez les bons temps rouler!” (“Let the good times roll!”). Whether this is your first time to New Orleans or you're a seasoned visitor, the city's invigorating spirit is sure to inspire, captivate and motivate you to jump in and see and do so much.  With so many options and many things to do all the time, narrowing the playing field can be a challenge.  Think of it this way: divide how much time you have by what your priorities are   history, art, music, culture, and on and on - and then add in a little time for the spontaneous joy that is the Crescent City's calling card. Subtract a few hours for sleep, multiply your dining pleasure by at least three times a day, and you have the perfect equation for an amazing New Orleans experience. New Orleans is an over-the-top experience for the senses, a city filled with vibrantly colored streets, soul-filled rhythm and blues, and memorable flavors. The coastal Louisiana enclave is the culinary heart of creole and cajun food, and beyond delicacies from gumbo to shrimp and grits, it's the city that brought us the muffuletta, beignets, and char-broiled oysters.  New Orleans, nicknamed ""The Big Easy,"" is a town of jazz kings and queens, iconic architecture, the New Orleans Saints, and perhaps the most spirited street in America—Bourbon Street. It's also one of the only cities in America where you can legally drink on the street, which only adds to the lively nature of NOLA nightlife. Comedian and actor Hannibal Burress famously said of the Big Easy that ""for $300 you can have your own parade on a day's notice,"" and if that doesn't beautifully encapsulate the glory of New Orleans in one sentence, we don't know what does.  For legendary New Orleans jazz, the best restaurants in New Orleans, and every other must-try activity, including tours of the bayou and ghost tours of the city's most haunted streets, consult this guide. We've mapped out exactly what to do in New Orleans to experience this renowned city of celebration and resilience. It's so easy to blow it—to never leave the French Quarter or end up in a Yelp-recommended jazz club on Bourbon Street that's packed with tourists wearing Mardi Gras beads no matter the time of year. The biggest problem you'll have here is that there's way too much to eat, drink, and see in this city to waste any meal, cocktail, or hours between lunch and dinner. What follows is our guide to never feeling like a tourist in a town crawling with them. New Orleans is known for its European-style architecture, mouthwatering Creole cuisine and all-around good-time vibes. Considered the birthplace of jazz, the city oozes music from every crevice, whether it's blues, rock 'n' roll or zydeco. Music plays a key role in the backbone and spirit of New Orleans. While most people travel to the Southern city for Mardi Gras, a Carnival-type event that features masks, music, floats and merriment, that's not the only party New Orleans hosts. Travelers will find plenty of events and festivals to attend year-round.   Post-Hurricane Katrina, the city has had its share of environmental disasters, such as the BP oil spill and Hurricane Isaac, which made the rebuilding of New Orleans challenging, but the city has persevered. Over the past several years, major efforts have been made to restore the distinct districts. Today, Crescent City looks almost as good as new. Start your visit with a walking tour through the French Quarter, where colonial heritage and ghost lore still survive. From here, you can explore the major architectural sites before enjoying a hearty plate of jambalaya and a rowdy evening out.  The city is also home to a bustling port. In fact, New Orleans is the sixth-largest cruise port in the U.S. Cruisers can travel to Mexico, the Caribbean or along the Mississppi River to Memphis, Tennessee, on a river cruise. With a vivacious community spirit and deep-rooted cultural fusion, New Orleans breathes the things that make life worth living: eating, drinking and celebrating. It's easy to love and hard to leave the Big Easy No matter the time of year, New Orleans welcomes its visitors in a grand way to experience Caribbean, Spanish, French and African cultures colliding in a brilliant explosion of flavors, emotions and sounds. Music is everywhere, people live to eat and every day is a party here in the birthplace of jazz, which is also home to Creole cuisine, centuries-old Spanish oak trees and clacking streetcars. With a unique combination of city life, swamp tours, festivals, historical significance and revelry during Mardi Gras, New Orleans has the recipe to captivate everyone. Absorbing History and Architecture Hop on the St. Charles Avenue, Canal Street or Riverfront streetcars to explore the more than 300-year-old city that is split by the Mississippi River and surrounded by lakes, bayous and bays. Admire the architecture in over 20 historic districts, more than any other city in the USA. See mansions on St. Charles Avenue, opulent estates in the Garden District and a revolving carousel bar at Hotel Monteleone. In the heart of the French Quarter, you'll want to linger in lively Jackson Square. After admiring artists' work hanging on the iron fence and, perhaps, getting your fortune told, cross the street to visit the 18th century St. Louis Cathedral, the USA's oldest continually operating cathedral. For a different perspective, tour the area aboard the Natchez steamboat or the Creole Queen paddle wheeler.     Eating Your Way Through the City To fuel all that sightseeing, make a pit stop at the French Market for a cup of caf¨¦ au lait paired with a beignet, or get a cold drink on Bourbon Street. Plot your course for the rest of the day, ensuring you'll have a chance to sample signature foods, including gumbo, jambalaya, po'boy sandwiches, boiled crawfish and charbroiled oysters. The city's restaurants, and chefs, consistently earn spots on lists ranking the best places to eat in the USA.     Tuning in to Music A music lovers' paradise that's home to Jazz, Zydeco, R&B and Soul, New Orleans has produced its share of musical giants, from greats like Louis Armstrong to contemporary acts like Trombone Shorty, Jon Batiste, Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr. Explore Frenchmen Street in the Faubourg Marigny, an original Creole neighborhood that's a mecca for nightclubs, bars and restaurants. Live music occurs every day and night of the year, and many venues feature award-winning performers throughout the week. A must-stop is Preservation Hall, dedicated to preserving the New Orleans Jazz tradition.     The Fun, Funky and Enlightening Also worthy of your time are visits to the National World War II Museum and the Presbytere and Cabildo state museums. Learn about voodoo traditions at shops and museums dotting the city. Dive into the history of Mardi Gras and see how its famous parade floats are made at Mardi Gras World. Take part in New Orleans cocktail culture with a visit to The Sazerac House, which is dedicated to the USA's original cocktail, the Sazerac. See something you like while exploring? Buy it.

From the lights of Times Square to the mists of Niagara Falls, Lake Placid's Olympic legacy to Cooperstown's baseball roots, Albany's 400-year history to Jamestown's comedy treasures, the castles of the Thousand Islands to Long Island's Gold Coast mansions, the Hudson Valley's inspiring landscapes to the Catskills' sweeping mountain views and stunning Finger Lakes wine country— there's something for everyone.   With top attractions that are totally worth the hype, like the Statue of Liberty and Strong National Museum of Play, unique experiences and hidden gem destinations there's no shortage of places to explore in New York. Discover the many wonders that make New York the country's most desirable vacation destination and enjoy some of the many fun and exciting things to do here.  Experience the endless treasures that New York State has to offer. Consider the thrill of parasailing hundreds of feet above scenic Lake George or horseback riding along a Long Island shoreline. Behold ""The Grand Canyon of the East,"" Letchworth State Park, or explore the unique rock formations and winding waterways at Ausable Chasm. Feel the exhilaration of whitewater rafting in the Adirondacks, hike the natural landscape, peaceful forests, and mountain scenery of the Catskills, or tour one of our picturesque villages or palatial homes. Like good food and drink? Tour the state's wine or craft beverage trails or dine out in the Hudson Valley.    Immerse yourself in New York State's many world-renowned museums and cultural institutions, and celebrate our proud history along the Path Through History. Pay tribute to the great achievements of our country's heroes by visiting one or all of our 15 Halls of Fame. To know ""The City"" like a local might still be the greatest badge of honor for travelers. But take a breath: you won't be able to cover the countless museums, galleries, restaurants, watering holes—and, yes, $1 pizza slices—all in one visit, but that's the good news. Now that the outer boroughs draw as much attention as Manhattan, it makes repeated trips not only possible, but essential.  Check out the views from the top of the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, or One World Observatory. Take yourself on a museum crawl, starting at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on the northeastern edge of Central Park. Then, make your way north several blocks to the Guggenheim Museum and eventually to the Museum of the City of New York, one of the best places to learn about the Big Apple's history.  Go to Chinatown for dim sum and to Little Italy for cannoli. Head to a jazz club in Harlem, check out the independent artist galleries that dot Chelsea, shop along Fifth Avenue, and pay a visit to the Statue of Liberty.  You could spend an entire day in Central Park alone, checking out its zoo, carousel, lakes, and ice rink. A number of gardens and meadows make for excellent people-watching and host impromptu musical performances on nice days. Traveling in the summer? Make sure to check the schedule for Shakespeare in the Park.  Prefer sports, movies, and live music? See the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, the New York Mets at Citi Field, or the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden. Track down sites from your favorite movies and TV shows. Seinfeld, Sex and the City, ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""Serendipity,"" and ""Home Alone 2"" are just a small fraction of what's been filmed here.  New York is a city filled with attractions, but some of its most interesting experiences are sure to be the ones you accidentally stumble upon on the way to somewhere else. Whatever it is you're looking for, you can find it in New York. Just don't try to do everything in one trip. Cool, cosmopolitan, crowded, constantly evolving  the Big Apple blends big city splendor with small-town charm. Amid New York's iconic landmarks and towering skyscrapers, you'll experience a vibrant culture permeating each of the city's distinctive neighborhoods and boroughs. Follow trendsetters to the East Village and Brooklyn to check out indie boutiques, iconic bakeries and trendy coffee shops. Afterward, peruse the racks of the sleek shops lining Fifth Avenue, admire the cutting-edge art collections at the MoMA and the Met, catch a memorable show on Broadway or sit down for a meal at the latest ""it"" restaurant.  As the most populous city in the U.S.   set at the forefront of food, fashion and the arts   NYC requires stamina. But don't let the Big Apple's frenetic sights and sounds intimidate you from soaking up its grandeur. Enlist the help of a local to help you navigate it all. Wander through the concrete jungle and you'll discover roaring taxis zipping down bustling blocks, fast-paced pedestrians strolling past on their way to marquee galleries and trendy cocktail bars, and Times Square's neon lights flickering at all hours. And yet, the city's twinkling lights and chaotic corners also invite you to embrace every New York minute, explore every enclave and create your own urban adventure. There are endless ways to spend your time in the city that never sleeps, but before you leave, stop and look around   what's here today will be transformed into something bigger and better tomorrow. For most, any trip to the Empire State starts or finishes in its iconic metropolis: New York City. However, if you confine your travels only to the five boroughs there's a considerable amount you're missing out on. A lifetime's worth of experiences in one city With a globally recognizable skyline and 8.4 million people who call it home, New York City is bursting with diversity and excitement   from the iconic attractions you've seen on TV and in the movies to hidden gems waiting to be uncovered. Each of the five boroughs   The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island   has a distinctive flavor, while individual neighborhoods maintain identities all their own. Walkable streets and access to the subway, buses and cabs make it easy to get from neighborhood to neighborhood. Whether it's your first visit or your hundredth, there's always something new to do. Iconic Attractions You've seen them a million times in the movies, but there's nothing like taking in these quintessential New York City landmarks in person. First stop, a tour of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, capped with a free ride on the Staten Island Ferry for stellar views of both.  Immerse yourself in the bustle and bright lights of Times Square followed by the incomparable spectacle of a Broadway show   both experiences that you can't find anywhere else but NYC. Explore Rockefeller Center, and take a trip to the top of the Empire State Building. Experience Grand Central Terminal, a unique architectural gem and the city's major transportation hub.     Steeped in Green Spaces & Scenery Central Park   the city's urban park centerpiece   is a 341-hectare oasis of meadows, arches and sculptures, as well as running paths and playgrounds. Other green spaces dot the city, including Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the Bronx's Pelham Bay Park, Staten Island's Greenbelt and Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens' largest, with a huge recreation center, plenty of room for sports and a botanical garden.  As panoramic scenes go, NYC can't be beat. Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge for views of New York Harbor and the city's skylines or scale 30 Rockefeller Plaza's Art Deco skyscraper to Top of The Rock, an observatory offering 360-degree views of the city. Newly-opened One World Observatory on the 100th floor of One World Trade Center shows off Manhattan, Brooklyn and New Jersey.     Must-see Museums Culture buffs love the world-renowned Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art's modern masterpieces and the Whitney Museum of American Art's many contemporary works. Stop at the enormous American Museum of Natural History to marvel at the rich collections on display.  Don't miss the numerous institutions outside Manhattan. The Brooklyn Museum, Queens Museum of Art, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the Staten Island Museum are all inspiring cultural destinations.     Fun for Everyone It's a clich¨¦ to say that New York is the ""city that never sleeps,"" but it's true. No matter what you're looking for   karaoke, live music, dancing   you can find it at all hours. See the New York Yankees' historic home ballpark. Head to Madison Square Garden to catch an ice hockey match, basketball game or concert.  There's plenty for families too: Visit Brooklyn's nostalgic beach neighborhood Coney Island to stroll the boardwalk and enjoy amusement park rides. At Bronx Zoo, the USA's largest metropolitan zoo, you'll see everything from American bison to baboons. If shopping is more your style, the five boroughs are brimming with department stores, boutiques, showrooms and vintage havens.","New York,New York"

424,Orlando,Florida,"It's easy to see why vacationers flock to Orlando: great resorts, year-round sunshine, and no shortage of things to do. You can go all in on theme parks, hopping between the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and Magic Kingdom, or spend a day in Winter Park, a scenic lake town with cute shops and an excellent farmers' market. Stargazers can tour Kennedy Space Center, nature lovers can kayak through Blue Spring State Park, and foodies can indulge at the city's Michelin-starred restaurants (it's got a few). Yes, Orlando has a family-friendly rep, but there's also a big nightlife scene, everything from dance clubs to speakeasies. For even more to do, check out our recs below.","Welcome to fairytale Orlando - known for its magic and so much more Sure, Orlando has tons of theme parks and glistening attractions, but there's a tale of two cities here, and it's not all about a giant mouse and his friends. The amusement parks are mesmerizing, invoking nostalgia for many travelers, while the city center has a pulsating culinary scene that keeps growing. Ultimately, the theme parks keep people returning, but the town's nightlife and award-winning gastronomic wonders are cultivating an entirely new interest and scene all on their own.  Orlando is a city whose history goes back a long time. Originally home to the Timucua and Tocobago Native Americans, it became a city in the 19th century, but the arrival of Walt Disney World_ changed the course of the city's history forever.. Modern-day Orlando is emerging as a cultural beacon of diversity, with different groups like Latinos and Asians coming together and creating a melting pot of foods, celebrations, and traditions. Who else can say they grew up eating Vietnamese and Puerto Rican food on the regular?","Home to world-famous theme parks that attract millions of visitors a year, like Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld, it comes as no surprise that Orlando is the number one top travel destination in the U.S.  Located in Central Florida, Orlando has everything from exciting theme parks to endless shopping and dining, plus the warm Florida sunshine, making it the perfect spot for an unforgettable family vacation.  If you've had your share of thrills, Orlando is also within driving distance to fun day trips from Orlando like the beach, Kennedy Space Center or natural springs and attractions.  Featured deals and activities: Transport to Orlando Theme Parks Orlando Manatee Encounters Museum of Illusions Orlando SEA LIFE Orlando Aquarium Orlando Magic NBA Basketball Tickets","If there was ever a city dedicated to enjoyment, Orlando would be it. Even the most cursory drive through the city will tell you one thing: there is no disguising the fact that Orlando is a city built on theme parks. Lots of them. However, it is strange to think that until the mid-20th century, there was precious little here in Central Florida. A few roadside attractions aside, it was one man, Walt Disney, who really changed the landscape. No matter which way you slice it, growth has spiralled thanks to a huge influx of tourists that followed the arrival of Walt Disney World Resort. Almost all of Florida’s cities and resorts are based around its long coastline, naturally capitalising on the beaches or swampland national parks that attract so many international visitors. Orlando is the only real exception, a strange, idiosyncratic place in the middle of the Floridian wasteland, and coincidentally one of the most famous resort towns in the world attracting over 70 million tourists a year. Most head straight to one of the theme parks, the biggest and most famous being Disney World. Beginning with the original Magic Kingdom, which opened in 1971, the park has expanded to encompass three more theme parks, two water parks, a mini-town called Disney Springs and a pretty lakeside stretch known as the Boardwalk. But while theme parks dominate, Orlando has built a distinct character of its own. There has been a stab at giving the city some historic context with the promotion of ‘Old Orlando’, a stretch of the increasingly gentrified Downtown which includes Orange and Garland Avenues. There is also the pretty Lake Eola, with brick streets lined with old oak trees and 19th-century homes, as well as retro roadside attractions such as Gatorland. Really though, Orlando is all about encouraging as many people to have as much fun as they can cram into a fortnight–whether that is at Disney World, Universal Studios or in the city centre itself.","Whether you're a theme park enthusiast, bird watcher, foodie, water sports fanatic, sun worshipper, arts patron, serious shopper or anything in between, you're always welcome here. The possibilities are endless. And wonder is always within reach. It's the getaway you deserve — and you'll only find it in Orlando. Whether it's a trip for families, couples, single travelers or a group of friends, Orlando is the perfect destination thanks to wondrous diversity that ensures an unforgettable vacation filled with unique experiences for every visitor. In short, you'll never run out of things to do in Orlando — and you'll make a lifetime of cherished memories while you're at it.  If thrill-seeking is your style, you won't be able to get enough of our open-air theme parks, expansive water parks and amazing attractions. But there is much more for you to discover, including authentic neighborhoods, uplifting art, acclaimed dining, sensational shopping, wild ecotourism and other things you won't want to miss. So, get out and explore it all — there's no wrong way to experience Orlando. Best known for theme parks, Orlando is home to more than a dozen family attractions, including Walt Disney World, Epcot, Sea Life Orlando Aquarium, and Universal Orlando, making the central Florida city the ""Theme Park Capital of the World."" Orlando is also called ""The City Beautiful,"" dating back to 1908 when city officials gave it the nickname that still appears on the city seal. The origin of the city's name is less clear, with several different stories and historical figures claimed as possible sources.  Since the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971, tourism, population, and the local economy have flourished. Orlando is America's most visited destination, with a record-setting 75 million visitors in 2018, according to Visit Orlando. Orlando International Airport is the busiest airport in the state of Florida.  Orlando is also home to industry, including high-tech, aviation and aerospace, biotechnology research, film and television production, and manufacturing. The Orange County Convention Center in Orlando is the second largest in the country, with an average of nearly 200 events annually.","There's no other city in the United States   the world, even   that celebrates the spirit of childhood quite like Orlando, Florida. The feeling that you get when you catch the light off EPCOT's Spaceship Earth (found in Walt Disney World Resort, of course); or from your first sip of Butterbeer in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley (located inside Universal Orlando Resort); or when you witness the soaring heights of Shamu's aerobatics (during the  Orca Encounter water show at SeaWorld Orlando)   all prove that being a kid is about your state of mind, not age. The notion that only young ones will enjoy this city's charms is just that   a notion. In reality, Orlando has a little of this and a little of that to appeal to all ages and there's more to do here than visit theme parks. The subtropical climate is great for golfing and the downtown city landscape is too attractive not to explore.","The state of Florida is diverse in its gifts, with everything from theme parks and Latin and Caribbean culture to wildlife, wetlands, and, of course, multitudes of beaches. A place where dreams come true, Orlando's a cosmopolitan city sprinkled with pixie dust. Sure, there's serious business going on here, but you wouldn't know it basking inside a sun-kissed swan paddleboat on Lake Eola, surrounded by towering skyscrapers in the heart of downtown. The ultimate in family fun, Orlando offers Disney parks, Universal, Gatorland, and other nearby attractions that keep kids awake weeks before arriving. There's also gator golf, a chocolate museum, a star-car museum, and, for when you really need a break from all the crowds and chaos (and you will!), Leu Gardens, a tranquil 50-acre botanical paradise. Best for family activities.","The ultimate theme park destination No place can inspire incredible stories quite like Orlando, Florida. While many visitors come for the legendary theme parks, Orlando's appeal goes beyond, rivaling the most enticing global locales with its robust dining scene, mega outlet shopping malls, outdoor recreation and unique local history. To say that there's something for everyone in Orlando is no magical thinking! Adventures at the Theme Parks Let's start with the big one: Walt Disney World Resort. This massive theme park complex includes four individual parks (Magic Kingdom Park, Disney's Hollywood Studios, EPCOT and Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park), plus two water parks (Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Water Park and Disney's Blizzard Beach Water Park), dozens of restaurants and uniquely themed accommodations. Of course, you can't overlook the area's other world-famous attractions including LEGOLAND Florida Resort, SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Orlando Resort, home to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.  On warmer days (and most are here in Florida), pull out your bathing suit and hit the water parks: Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon at Walt Disney World, Aquatica and Discovery Cove at SeaWorld, Universal's Volcano Bay, and LEGOLAND Florida Water Park.  When it comes time to plan your own theme park vacation, make sure to buy early, book early and save plenty of room on your camera for the unforgettable fun ahead.     Culture, History and More Beyond the Theme Parks Get to know 12,000 years of local history at the Orange County Regional History Center. The Morse Museum in Winter Park holds the world's most comprehensive collection of works by Louis Comfort Tiffany (of Tiffany lamp and Tiffany & Co. fame). Take a stroll through the colorful flora at Harry P. Leu Gardens, a 20-hectare outdoor sanctuary nestled at the shore of Lake Rowena. Rent a bike to pedal your way around bustling downtown Orlando using the city's bike-sharing program.  Be sure to park at Lake Eola Park located in the city center for a stroll along the water and a ride on one of the park's signature swan-shaped paddle boats. Lake Eola also hosts the Orlando Farmers Market every Sunday. The crystal-clear water of Rock Springs calls for a paddling trip in a transparent kayak; Get Up and Go Kayaking offers guided excursions at this and several nearby parks in these fun, see-through vessels.     Shopping and Dining Galore Within a 20-minute drive of Walt Disney World is The Florida Mall, Orlando International Premium Outlets and Mall at Millenia, boasting luxury shops such as Bulgari, Versace and Tiffany & Co. You can easily pass the time from lunch to late night at Disney Springs, which bursts with shopping, dining and entertainment options from casual to trendy to upscale. Universal CityWalk also packs in the good times; eat, shop, dance or see a concert at Hard Rock Caf¨¦.  When hunger calls, you'll have a tough time deciding where to go — including 33 Michelin Guide restaurants. You'll find upscale dining (Orlando is home to 17 James Beard Award-honored chefs), international flavors (about 40 ethnic cuisines are represented) and health-conscious (Orlando is ranked a top vegan- and vegetarian-friendly destination by Livability and WalletHub).","['Kid-Friendly (4)', 'Theme Parks (21)', 'Rides & Activities (77)', 'Day Trips (38)', 'Museum Tickets & Passes (9)', 'Disney Parks & Activities (35)', '4WD Tours (1)', 'Dinner and Show Tickets (2)', 'Theme Parks (33)', 'Self-guided Tours (22)', 'Bus Tours (45)', 'Parks (22)', 'Stand Up Paddleboarding (12)', 'Historical Tours (22)', 'Shopping Malls (13)', 'Airport & Hotel Transfers (341)', 'Top Picks', 'Likely to Sell Out (22)', 'Special Offer (13)', 'Air, Helicopter & Balloon Tours (11)', 'Weddings & Honeymoons (5)', 'Luxury & Special Occasions (4)', 'Holiday & Seasonal Tours (2)', 'Multi-day & Extended Tours (2)', 'Ports of Call Tours (2)', 'Art Classes  (1)', 'Map']","['Kid-Friendly', 'Theme Parks', 'Rides & Activities', 'Day Trips', 'Museum Tickets & Passes', 'Disney Parks & Activities', '4WD Tours', 'Dinner and Show Tickets', 'Theme Parks', 'Self-guided Tours', 'Bus Tours', 'Parks', 'Stand Up Paddleboarding', 'Historical Tours', 'Shopping Malls', 'Airport & Hotel Transfers', 'Top Picks', 'Likely to Sell Out', 'Special Offer', 'Air, Helicopter & Balloon Tours', 'Weddings & Honeymoons', 'Luxury & Special Occasions', 'Holiday & Seasonal Tours', 'Multi-day & Extended Tours', 'Ports of Call Tours', 'Art Classes ', 'Map']","It's easy to see why vacationers flock to Orlando: great resorts, year-round sunshine, and no shortage of things to do.

Welcome to fairytale Orlando - known for its magic and so much more Sure, Orlando has tons of theme parks and glistening attractions, but there's a tale of two cities here, and it's not all about a giant mouse and his friends. The amusement parks are mesmerizing, invoking nostalgia for many travelers, while the city center has a pulsating culinary scene that keeps growing. Ultimately, the theme parks keep people returning, but the town's nightlife and award-winning gastronomic wonders are cultivating an entirely new interest and scene all on their own.  Orlando is a city whose history goes back a long time. Originally home to the Timucua and Tocobago Native Americans, it became a city in the 19th century, but the arrival of Walt Disney World_ changed the course of the city's history forever.. Modern-day Orlando is emerging as a cultural beacon of diversity, with different groups like Latinos and Asians coming together and creating a melting pot of foods, celebrations, and traditions. Who else can say they grew up eating Vietnamese and Puerto Rican food on the regular? Home to world-famous theme parks that attract millions of visitors a year, like Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld, it comes as no surprise that Orlando is the number one top travel destination in the U.S.  Located in Central Florida, Orlando has everything from exciting theme parks to endless shopping and dining, plus the warm Florida sunshine, making it the perfect spot for an unforgettable family vacation.  If you've had your share of thrills, Orlando is also within driving distance to fun day trips from Orlando like the beach, Kennedy Space Center or natural springs and attractions.  Featured deals and activities: Transport to Orlando Theme Parks Orlando Manatee Encounters Museum of Illusions Orlando SEA LIFE Orlando Aquarium Orlando Magic NBA Basketball Tickets If there was ever a city dedicated to enjoyment, Orlando would be it. Even the most cursory drive through the city will tell you one thing: there is no disguising the fact that Orlando is a city built on theme parks. Lots of them. However, it is strange to think that until the mid-20th century, there was precious little here in Central Florida. A few roadside attractions aside, it was one man, Walt Disney, who really changed the landscape. No matter which way you slice it, growth has spiralled thanks to a huge influx of tourists that followed the arrival of Walt Disney World Resort. Almost all of Florida’s cities and resorts are based around its long coastline, naturally capitalising on the beaches or swampland national parks that attract so many international visitors. Orlando is the only real exception, a strange, idiosyncratic place in the middle of the Floridian wasteland, and coincidentally one of the most famous resort towns in the world attracting over 70 million tourists a year. Most head straight to one of the theme parks, the biggest and most famous being Disney World. Beginning with the original Magic Kingdom, which opened in 1971, the park has expanded to encompass three more theme parks, two water parks, a mini-town called Disney Springs and a pretty lakeside stretch known as the Boardwalk. But while theme parks dominate, Orlando has built a distinct character of its own. There has been a stab at giving the city some historic context with the promotion of ‘Old Orlando’, a stretch of the increasingly gentrified Downtown which includes Orange and Garland Avenues. There is also the pretty Lake Eola, with brick streets lined with old oak trees and 19th-century homes, as well as retro roadside attractions such as Gatorland. Really though, Orlando is all about encouraging as many people to have as much fun as they can cram into a fortnight–whether that is at Disney World, Universal Studios or in the city centre itself. Whether you're a theme park enthusiast, bird watcher, foodie, water sports fanatic, sun worshipper, arts patron, serious shopper or anything in between, you're always welcome here. The possibilities are endless. And wonder is always within reach. It's the getaway you deserve — and you'll only find it in Orlando. Whether it's a trip for families, couples, single travelers or a group of friends, Orlando is the perfect destination thanks to wondrous diversity that ensures an unforgettable vacation filled with unique experiences for every visitor. In short, you'll never run out of things to do in Orlando — and you'll make a lifetime of cherished memories while you're at it.  If thrill-seeking is your style, you won't be able to get enough of our open-air theme parks, expansive water parks and amazing attractions. But there is much more for you to discover, including authentic neighborhoods, uplifting art, acclaimed dining, sensational shopping, wild ecotourism and other things you won't want to miss. So, get out and explore it all — there's no wrong way to experience Orlando. Best known for theme parks, Orlando is home to more than a dozen family attractions, including Walt Disney World, Epcot, Sea Life Orlando Aquarium, and Universal Orlando, making the central Florida city the ""Theme Park Capital of the World."" Orlando is also called ""The City Beautiful,"" dating back to 1908 when city officials gave it the nickname that still appears on the city seal. The origin of the city's name is less clear, with several different stories and historical figures claimed as possible sources.  Since the opening of Walt Disney World in 1971, tourism, population, and the local economy have flourished. Orlando is America's most visited destination, with a record-setting 75 million visitors in 2018, according to Visit Orlando. Orlando International Airport is the busiest airport in the state of Florida.  Orlando is also home to industry, including high-tech, aviation and aerospace, biotechnology research, film and television production, and manufacturing. The Orange County Convention Center in Orlando is the second largest in the country, with an average of nearly 200 events annually. There's no other city in the United States   the world, even   that celebrates the spirit of childhood quite like Orlando, Florida. The feeling that you get when you catch the light off EPCOT's Spaceship Earth (found in Walt Disney World Resort, of course); or from your first sip of Butterbeer in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley (located inside Universal Orlando Resort); or when you witness the soaring heights of Shamu's aerobatics (during the  Orca Encounter water show at SeaWorld Orlando)   all prove that being a kid is about your state of mind, not age. The notion that only young ones will enjoy this city's charms is just that   a notion. In reality, Orlando has a little of this and a little of that to appeal to all ages and there's more to do here than visit theme parks. The subtropical climate is great for golfing and the downtown city landscape is too attractive not to explore. The state of Florida is diverse in its gifts, with everything from theme parks and Latin and Caribbean culture to wildlife, wetlands, and, of course, multitudes of beaches. A place where dreams come true, Orlando's a cosmopolitan city sprinkled with pixie dust. Sure, there's serious business going on here, but you wouldn't know it basking inside a sun-kissed swan paddleboat on Lake Eola, surrounded by towering skyscrapers in the heart of downtown. The ultimate in family fun, Orlando offers Disney parks, Universal, Gatorland, and other nearby attractions that keep kids awake weeks before arriving. There's also gator golf, a chocolate museum, a star-car museum, and, for when you really need a break from all the crowds and chaos (and you will!), Leu Gardens, a tranquil 50-acre botanical paradise. Best for family activities. The ultimate theme park destination No place can inspire incredible stories quite like Orlando, Florida. While many visitors come for the legendary theme parks, Orlando's appeal goes beyond, rivaling the most enticing global locales with its robust dining scene, mega outlet shopping malls, outdoor recreation and unique local history. To say that there's something for everyone in Orlando is no magical thinking! Adventures at the Theme Parks Let's start with the big one: Walt Disney World Resort. This massive theme park complex includes four individual parks (Magic Kingdom Park, Disney's Hollywood Studios, EPCOT and Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park), plus two water parks (Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Water Park and Disney's Blizzard Beach Water Park), dozens of restaurants and uniquely themed accommodations. Of course, you can't overlook the area's other world-famous attractions including LEGOLAND Florida Resort, SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Orlando Resort, home to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.  On warmer days (and most are here in Florida), pull out your bathing suit and hit the water parks: Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon at Walt Disney World, Aquatica and Discovery Cove at SeaWorld, Universal's Volcano Bay, and LEGOLAND Florida Water Park.  When it comes time to plan your own theme park vacation, make sure to buy early, book early and save plenty of room on your camera for the unforgettable fun ahead.     Culture, History and More Beyond the Theme Parks Get to know 12,000 years of local history at the Orange County Regional History Center. The Morse Museum in Winter Park holds the world's most comprehensive collection of works by Louis Comfort Tiffany (of Tiffany lamp and Tiffany & Co. fame). Take a stroll through the colorful flora at Harry P. Leu Gardens, a 20-hectare outdoor sanctuary nestled at the shore of Lake Rowena. Rent a bike to pedal your way around bustling downtown Orlando using the city's bike-sharing program.  Be sure to park at Lake Eola Park located in the city center for a stroll along the water and a ride on one of the park's signature swan-shaped paddle boats. Lake Eola also hosts the Orlando Farmers Market every Sunday. The crystal-clear water of Rock Springs calls for a paddling trip in a transparent kayak; Get Up and Go Kayaking offers guided excursions at this and several nearby parks in these fun, see-through vessels.     Shopping and Dining Galore Within a 20-minute drive of Walt Disney World is The Florida Mall, Orlando International Premium Outlets and Mall at Millenia, boasting luxury shops such as Bulgari, Versace and Tiffany & Co. You can easily pass the time from lunch to late night at Disney Springs, which bursts with shopping, dining and entertainment options from casual to trendy to upscale. Universal CityWalk also packs in the good times; eat, shop, dance or see a concert at Hard Rock Caf¨¦.  When hunger calls, you'll have a tough time deciding where to go — including 33 Michelin Guide restaurants. You'll find upscale dining (Orlando is home to 17 James Beard Award-honored chefs), international flavors (about 40 ethnic cuisines are represented) and health-conscious (Orlando is ranked a top vegan- and vegetarian-friendly destination by Livability and WalletHub).","Orlando,Florida"

Not that a passing glance would reveal it. At first glimpse, Phoenix looks like nothing so much as a collection of faux-adobe homes interspersed with clumps of saguaro cacti. Delve a little deeper however and there’s much to like about Phoenix, not least its university-dominated Downtown. Here, you’ll find a slew of interesting museums, among them the excellent Heard Museum which charts the area’s Native American past, much of it dominated by the Navajo. Then, there’s the Phoenix Art Museum, the largest in the south-western United States, which boasts a permanent collection of contemporary classics as well as a roster of ever-changing temporary exhibitions. Downtown is also home to the Arizona Cardinals, based at the vast University of Phoenix stadium, and the equally popular Arizona Diamondbacks whose home is at the sprawling Maryvale Baseball Park. Close by is the Desert Botanical Garden, which showcases a cross-section of the local fauna, including yet more saguaro cacti. Further natural beauty is to be found in Scottsdale; a ritzy suburb that meanders along the bottom of the beautiful Salt River Valley. Along with more than 200 golf clubs and resorts, the area is also home to a network of hiking trails as well as some of the city’s most upmarket bars. Scottsdale is bordered by Tempe, another major hub for drinkers that includes the buzzing Mill Avenue. The final piece of the puzzle is Mesa, a short drive from Downtown Phoenix and famous for its museums and archaeological sites. The best-known of these is the Mesa Grande, a series of structures built by the Hohokam people from whom the modern Navajo, among others, are descended. It serves as a reminder, were one ever needed, that Phoenix, although ultra-modern at first glance, has more historical depth than most give it credit for.","For centuries, the Sonoran Desert has been a source of innovation and inspiration. It began with the Hohokam people, who created canals that fed a civilization for more than a thousand years. Today, it can be found throughout the nation's fifth-largest city in a thriving community that elevates art, culture, cuisine and more to levels of greatness.

Phoenix has transformed from a cattle town of 65,000 people in 1950 to a desert metropolis of 1.6 million. Explosive growth is a dominant feature of the city. People are moving to town from across the country. Downtown has sprouted a top-notch food-and-beverage scene anchored by flour-tortilla-and-steak-heavy Sonoran Mexican cuisine. Street art from Latino/a and Indigenous painters covers more and more facades every day. Despite the rapid change, many of the city's core attractions remain the same. Against the odds and from the Salt and Gila rivers in a desert basin—one so hot it can ground jets in the summer—Phoenix arose. And it's still rising today.","Referred to as ""LA without the Pacific,"" Phoenix combines high-end shopping, a flourishing restaurant scene and resort life in the Sonoran Desert.

What's more, Phoenix is a convenient jumping-off point for some of the best Arizona tours, including exciting all-terrain vehicle rides through the desert. Phoenix may not have the glitz and the seaside boardwalk of Los Angeles, but you'll find yourself hardly wanting those elements when you relax poolside before your afternoon hike or massage.","At first glance, downtown Phoenix appears to be all buttoned-up business and bureaucracy (the state capitol is here), but it does have a spring in its step.

This is a city of stone and steel, with old public libraries and brick row houses beside wide bridges and towering skyscrapers. There's an old-school class to Pittsburgh's good looks, underlined by an attitude towards dining, drinking and the arts that is genuinely innovative.

The rationale goes back to the days of the Gold Rush when it was a hotbed for gold diggers — actual miners, not the other kind. And though it's not celebrity-studded or on the seaside, the seat of California's state government has plenty of culture. For this reason, the Capitol building of aptly named Capitol Park is the first stop for many visitors. And there is more to explore. The Midtown neighborhood hosts burgeoning theater and nightlife scenes that cosmopolitan visitors will appreciate. The Gold Rush may be over, but Sacramento's still a great place to be.  The Golden State's capital is rooted in history. Before Spanish settlers claimed the land in the 1840s, the Nisenan branch of Maidu Native Americans inhabited the Sacramento Valley. With the California Gold Rush of the 1850s, the area saw the largest migration in the country's history. Nowadays, the region is known as the most affordable of the California destinations. Plus it is home to plentiful outdoor activities, 200 parks and two rivers, and it's also the self-proclaimed ""Farm-to-Fork Capital of America"" with a large agricultural production of grapes, pears, corn and livestock. No matter what your interest, it's safe to say Sacramento won't leave you bored.","Sacramento is a city of contrasts.

Best of all, Sacramento hosts a wide variety of major events including the Farm-to-Fork Festival, Aftershock Music Festival, GoldenSky Country Music Festival, free Friday night Concerts in the Park, and more. So why is Sacramento the capital of California? The rationale goes back to the days of the Gold Rush when it was a hotbed for gold diggers — actual miners, not the other kind. And though it's not celebrity-studded or on the seaside, the seat of California's state government has plenty of culture. For this reason, the Capitol building of aptly named Capitol Park is the first stop for many visitors. And there is more to explore. The Midtown neighborhood hosts burgeoning theater and nightlife scenes that cosmopolitan visitors will appreciate. The Gold Rush may be over, but Sacramento's still a great place to be.  The Golden State's capital is rooted in history. Before Spanish settlers claimed the land in the 1840s, the Nisenan branch of Maidu Native Americans inhabited the Sacramento Valley. With the California Gold Rush of the 1850s, the area saw the largest migration in the country's history. Nowadays, the region is known as the most affordable of the California destinations. Plus it is home to plentiful outdoor activities, 200 parks and two rivers, and it's also the self-proclaimed ""Farm-to-Fork Capital of America"" with a large agricultural production of grapes, pears, corn and livestock. No matter what your interest, it's safe to say Sacramento won't leave you bored. Sacramento is a city of contrasts. It's a former cow town where state legislators' SUVs go bumper-to-bumper with farmers' muddy, half-ton pickups at rush hour. It has sprawling suburbs, but also new lofts and upscale boutiques squeezed between aging mid-century storefronts. ","Sacramento,California"

A visit to the Alamo is an absolute must, as is taking in a show at the ornate Majestic Theatre. San Antonio Missions National Historical Park is dotted with 18th-century buildings and features, making for an enriching excursion.","San Antonio is Texas' star attraction. This beautiful colonial city (founded in 1691) is small enough to feel friendly and welcoming, has a walkable downtown core, and plenty of attractions for visitors to enjoy. It's the kind of destination where it's easy to blend history, culture, and sporting spectacles in a single day of sight-seeing. History fans can relive the siege of the Alamo by visiting the historic fort, or tour elegant Spanish missions. Art lovers can spend a day wandering around the San Antonio Museum of Art, and basketball fans can enjoy the San Antonio Spurs. There's constant sunshine, family attractions like the Zoo and Sea World, and some of the best Mexican restaurants this side of the Rio Grande. Dine on tacos and fajitas at Mama Margie's, discover street food vendors like La Gloria, or hit the bars along the beautiful River Walk. It all adds up to a little gem of a city, a unique fusion of cultures where gourmet food, art, sports, and history combine to create something truly special. The Weather San Antonio has a sun-drenched Texan climate, with very few months of the year when rain is likely. Summer temperatures can be too hot for some, but in spring and fall, the city is a fantastic place to be for the climate alone.

This long colonial history has left a beautiful architectural legacy, with buildings like the Alamo and the Catholic outposts in the San Antonio Missions National Historic Park. Food San Antonio mixes great Mexican (or Tex-Mex) food with cuisine from all across the world. If you love tacos or fajitas, there's no better city to visit. Try the beef fajitas at Mama Margie's, the fish tacos at the Cove, or head to Chris Madrid's for an authentic, meat-filled burger.

Highlights include the Museo Alameda, which showcases Latino history in the U.S.A. and SAMA, the San Antonio Museum of Art, which features collections from the Mediterranean, Asia, Latin America, and leading contemporary artists.","Although Dallas and Houston are often the first cities that come to mind when people think of Texas, many Texans will tell you that San Antonio is their favorite. This could be because of the lovely Spanish colonial churches, the fantastic River Walk neighborhood and, of course, the Alamo.  The city is navigable and rather small. It also boasts a lot of fantastic resorts and luxurious hotels that are just waiting for you to check in and be treated.

With a string of hot new hotel openings and a legit Baja-Med food scene, San Diego is stepping out from the shadow of its big sister due north, earning world-class destination status beyond its famous theme parks. Come for the sunshine, but stay for the perfect lunch-time tacos you'll burn off at the beach later that day Consistently sunny weather and 70 miles of magnificent coastline are what draw active types and sun seekers alike to San Diego throughout the year: that and the mouthwatering Mexican cuisine, thriving nightlife and one of the country's favorite zoos. And then there are the beaches: Retreat to Mission Beach to catch a wave, to La Jolla to soak up the sun and to Coronado for a leisurely seaside stroll. What's more, San Diego offers some of the best California tours, including whale watching tours, boat tours and fishing charters. When you're ready to ditch your flip-flops and board shorts for more formal attire, you'll find pockets of vivacious nightlife throughout, especially near the historical Gaslamp Quarter. The San Diego surfer with tousled hair, a great tan and gentle enthusiasm is not a myth; they look like they're on a perennial vacation, and when they wish you welcome, they mean it. Beachside vibes and big-city excitement With 112 kilometers of beaches, friendly locals and great weather, California's second largest city is the perfect mix of urban sophistication and laid-back beach culture.

Head to ""Beer Boulevard"" (30th Street) in the North Park neighborhood, ""Beer-a-Mar"" (Miramar Road) or the ""Hops Highway"" (Highway 78 Corridor).  The influence of neighboring Mexico is rich here, resulting in a distinct ""Cali-Baja"" culture found in the architecture, food, art and more. Cali-Baja cuisine combines the creativity and freshness of Californian cooking with Mexico's Baja-Mediterranean movement. Also influenced by Mexican culture is Barrio Logan, a hidden gem for trend-setting art, authentic local galleries, boutiques, brewpubs and craft coffee.

The park, now a National Historic Landmark, is recognized as the largest collection of Chicano murals in the world.     Hallowed History San Diego is also the birthplace of California. At Cabrillo National Monument, learn about the 1542 landing of Juan Rodriquez Cabrillo, the first European explorer to set foot on the USA's West Coast. Walk the Bayside Trail, bike Cabrillo Memorial Drive, tour the Old Point Loma Lighthouse and keep an eye on the tide pools for when low tide reveals sea creatures inhabiting the reef.

For a more authentic-to-Seattle experience, take in the iconic Space Needle before exploring the architecture in the famous Queen Anne neighborhood below. But most of all, make sure to work in some time to just hang out-Seattle has so many eclectic shops, restaurants, and bars to check out. And of course, you can't skip the coffee: Grab some as you snack and shop at Pike Place Market or dip into one of the many indie cafes around town (the city really knows how to amp up the coziness so there's always a great spot to settle into, rain or shine). We've got plenty more recs below.","Snowy peaks poke up behind Seattle's skyline, calling locals and visitors to the hundreds of acres of parks in town and the Cascade foothills, just 45 minutes from Downtown. Seattle's natural beauty has long drawn the world's best and brightest, and the mark of innovative entrepreneurs shows in many ways _ like how hometown company Starbucks cemented Seattle as coffee country. My version of a quintessential Seattle day, to introduce a newcomer to the city, starts with a traipse through old-growth evergreen trees, followed by a morning cappuccino and taking a boat through one of the city's major waterways. It finishes with a seafood dinner and a live show in one of the clubs that once nurtured the famous grunge scene of the 1990s, and still books cutting-edge local acts. It doesn't necessarily cover the tourist hotspots, but Seattle's laid back appeal shines best through these types of everyday activities that show off what it's like in a city where people obsess over whether ""the mountain is out"" _ if clouds are obscuring Mt. Rainier. After decades of living here, we all still gasp at the majesty of Mt. Rainier peeking out from the southern horizon and laugh at ourselves for wearing identical REI coats. The best way to understand Seattle is to don your own fleece jacket, practice reciting your coffee order (double tall oat-milk latt¨¦, anyone?), and read on to learn about Seattle's unique brand of Pacific Northwest culture.","Number 13 for top travel destinations in the U.S. takes us to the Pacific Northwest city of Seattle, Washington.

Seattleites are a relaxed bunch, just as happy catching waves on Puget Sound or hiking in Olympic National Park as they are sipping cold brews in Starbucks, rummaging through vintage fashion stores or grooving to the latest tunes in speakeasy-style basement bars. The city has a well-deserved reputation for fostering creativity and enterprise. This is the birthplace of global mega-brands Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing, but it's also a spawning ground for fabulously eccentric micro-companies. In the kookier neighbourhoods you can barely move for independent book stores, nano-breweries and pot shops. Then there are the wonderfully weird institutions – the underground Metaphysical Library; the 'Official Bad Art' museum; the giant troll lurking underneath a Fremont overpass. Of course, Seattle doesn't lack for more conventional attractions. No visit to the city would be complete without a trip up the Space Needle, with its world-beating views over Puget Sound and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains. There's also a first-class art museum, a superb science centre, a waterfront aquarium, the shimmering Frank Gehry-designed EMP Museum and an extraordinary garden of organic glass sculptures at Chihuly Garden and Glass. MOHAI (Museum of History and Industry), meanwhile, ignites curiosity in Seattle's past in its sprawling location at Lake Union Park, and the Seattle Great Wheel whirls seaside lovers round and round on a downtown waterfront pier. Exploring Seattle's neighbourhoods is like meeting different family members. There's Capitol Hill with its indie boutiques and hidden speakeasy bars, Ballard and its Scandinavian-infused historic streets, or funky Fremont, the self-dubbed 'centre of the universe'. Downtown's shiny skyscrapers rub shoulders with heritage buildings around Pioneer Square, home to the original settlers. Culture more your thing? From cutting-edge theatrical productions to folk, rock and opera performances, the city that brought the world grunge continues to set trends. Over 100,000 visitors attend Bumbershoot, North America's largest urban arts festival, held each Labor Day weekend. Seattle's culinary scene is thriving too, with new restaurants opening every week and food festivals running throughout the summer. With an eclectic nightlife scene and stellar shopping to boot, there's little this stylish city can't offer.","Whether you're a family looking for budget-friendly finds or a seasoned traveler on the hunt for the latest Instagram-worthy vista, the Emerald City has you covered. While here, you can meet artisan makers, shop indie boutiques and designer fashions, admire priceless works of art, sing your heart out at a karaoke club, explore like a local in the city's diverse neighborhoods, and enjoy nature—all without ever having to leave the city. No matter what you're looking for, the perfect adventure awaits. Seattle doesn't really care what you think of it—the weather, the coffee, the flying fish. It's heard it all before. The Emerald City prefers to keep a low profile, like a celebrity (say Bill Gates) living in the suburbs, but we can't help but call it out. You need to know the truth: It's one of the best cities in the U.S. for foodies (the holy seafood trifecta—Dungeness crab, wild salmon, and oysters—is totally local!); it has a lively indie music scene that has nothing to do with grunge; and, framed by Elliot Bay and snow-capped Mount Rainier, it's got to be one of the prettiest in the country.  The Pacific Northwest is known for its unadulterated natural beauty — from picturesque waterfronts to mountains beyond the city — and truly excellent coffee. And Seattle, as a hub of the PNW, is a perfect gateway to the area. Seattle feels simultaneously like a buzzing city and an outdoor lover's paradise. Lined by the Puget Sound, Lake Union, and Lake Washington, it's also home to some of the best seafood in the country, which is part of the reason why its food scene is so revered. Beyond the terrific restaurants, Seattle is known for its long and storied music history — it's the land of Jimi Hendrix, The Postal Service, Nirvana, Macklemore, Foo Fighters, and Pearl Jam, among others.  As for Seattle's tourist attractions, you'll spend your days taking the monorail between sites like Pike Place Market, Olympic Sculpture Park, and the Space Needle. From strolling Pike Place Market at lunch, to curling up with a book at a local coffee shop on a rainy afternoon, to hitting the music clubs in Belltown, you'll spend a few days in Seattle and quickly find you'll never want to leave.","Seattle's laid-back attitude and diverse neighborhoods more than make up for its consistently cloudy weather. Plus, it's home to some of the country's best coffee and a thriving arts scene, plenty of history, culture and   when the weather permits   some exciting outdoor activities. Surrounded by water (and resting between Puget Sound and Lake Washington), the city's favorite outdoor pursuits include kayaking, hiking, camping and whale watching. Not only that, but the nearby Olympic Mountains and the giant Mount Rainier are visible from many spots in the city; ski slopes are just a short drive away. And while travelers often bemoan the weather, there's actually less annual precipitation here than in New York or Boston. Overcast skies rarely stop Seattleites from getting out and exploring the city   and it shouldn't stop you either.  If you're headed to the Emerald City and not up for strenuous outdoor activities, Seattle still offers plenty to do and see. Art lovers will appreciate the glass-blown pieces at Chihuly Garden and Glass as well as the works on display at the Seattle Art Museum.

But most of all, make sure to work in some time to just hang out-Seattle has so many eclectic shops, restaurants, and bars to check out. And of course, you can't skip the coffee: Grab some as you snack and shop at Pike Place Market or dip into one of the many indie cafes around town (the city really knows how to amp up the coziness so there's always a great spot to settle into, rain or shine).

149,Washington DC,District of Columbia,"Washington, D.C.'s rep is spot on: For history and politics, you can't get any closer to the action. But what you might not know is its softer side. The city has over 600 parks, and in the spring, you can see the National Mall all decked out in its famous cherry blossoms. Or, stroll through Georgetown-D.C.'s oldest neighborhood-to find cool shops and restaurants alongside buildings from the 1700s. And while you definitely shouldn't miss the major monuments and Smithsonian museums, there are plenty of lesser-known landmarks, too. Check out Hillwood Estate (go for the Russian and French art, stay for the 13-acre garden), and the Municipal Fish Market-it's the oldest in the U.S. and it's got killer crab cakes.

If you want to see how politics is done, tours of the White House or Capitol Hill are a must.

You can get a great sense of how America has developed by touring attractions like the Lincoln Memorial, Ford's Theater and the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial.

But there’s more to the city than marble colossi and thrusting politicos. DC has a throbbing social scene (complete with some of the best clubs on the eastern seaboard), quaint little suburbs thronged with bohemian locals and green city parks housing diverse wildlife. For most, however, it’s Washington DC’s abundance of monuments that make the city a must-visit; whether it’s the iconic Lincoln Memorial on whose steps Martin Luther King made his ‘I Have a Dream’ speech or the dominating Washington Monument. Founded in 1790 as a ‘neutral’ capital, straddling the then hotly-contested dividing line between north and south, Washington DC has elements of both. From the north, it takes its patrician architecture and icy winters, while from the south comes the scorching summers and its bonhomie. Washington is a city of buzzing suburbs, with much of the night time action happening, unusually, outside of the city centre. Downtown DC, home to the Capitol, the White House and the Smithsonian, is an oddly somnolent place at night, lacking the buzz of New York and only really coming alive when the Senate is in session. Nevertheless, it continues to draw visitors from all over the world, many of whom come to see its haunting war memorials: the innovative Korean War Veterans Memorial, the touching Iwo Jima bronze sculpture and the ridiculously ugly contraption sent by a grateful Netherlands following the end of WWII. DC is a city that embraces all nationalities. The seat of American power draws all comers, a fact made plain by the imposing edifices along embassy row, and the huge variety of cuisine that dominates the restaurant scene. Oddly enough, DC is one of the best places to try Ethiopian food outside of Africa. That, however, doesn’t mean you won’t find excellent homegrown fare. Near to Chesapeake Bay, Washington is famous for its oysters and lump crab cakes, both of which offer the perfect solution to hunger pangs during a late night debate.","You can find all the best things to do right here in DC, from concerts and cultural events to American history, free attractions and so much more. It's easy to ride the Metro or hop on a bike and explore all that the nation's capital has to offer. Walk the halls of free Smithsonian museums, paddle on the Potomac and Anacostia rivers or sit back on a double-decker tour bus and soak up some history. Local shops, funky marketplaces and people-watching hot spots beckon by midday, as nighttime gives way to multi-course dinners and drinks from local breweries.  Washington, D.C. is so much more than the political epicenter of the U.S. The city offers legendary museums, one of the best hotels in the country in 2022, and a calendar full of fun events for the entire family. History buffs will love stepping back in time at the National Mall, and anyone with a passion for reading will swoon at the book collection in the Library of Congress. Nature lovers should opt for a springtime visit, when the cherry blossoms bloom and events start to trickle outside, including the Blossom Kite Festival. And let's not forget that the country's capital is also a college town, with universities like Georgetown, Howard, George Washington, and American all within city limits. Culturally speaking, D.C. is still as politically charged as you've heard: Networking is so embedded in the daily goings-on, the question ""So, what do you do?"" is a local punchline. The place is about power plays and shaking things up—but the buttoned-up Hill and K Street are hardly representative. The city has always attracted insurgents, nonconformists, and punks, and in recent years, they've made their presence known across dining, arts, and activism. From the smartly revitalized Wharf and Navy Yards—where the city's long-dormant sports scene has been reawakened—to neighborhoods like U Street and Adams Morgan, luring fans to spots like Maydan, which blends Middle Eastern and North African flavors, and to the recent, avant-garde hotel newcomers, it's the people away from the seat of the Capitol shaping the city today.","With its marbled monuments and high-profile politicos, Washington, D.C., has long been saddled with a reputation as a stuffy government-driven town. A ""city of southern efficiency and northern charm,"" as John F. Kennedy once described it, Washington is often seen by outsiders as slow and inefficient. But these days, our nation's capital is awash with a new energy, transforming itself into an exciting, faster-paced East Coast vacation destination. Although the government is still the sun around which this city orbits, the District also offers a host of renowned museums and interesting neighborhoods. And with an explosion of restaurants, cafes, boutiques and clubs, D.C. has become a thriving cultural hub.   You can choose a traditional D.C. adventure, filled with tours of classic attractions like the White House and the Washington Monument, the U.S. Capitol and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. And there's no better way to experience iconic D.C. than with a stroll around the Tidal Basin. (Plan to visit in late March or early April   just in time for the National Cherry Blossom Festival   and you'll be rewarded with a canopy of beautiful pink blooms.) But if you've already seen the national landmarks, get a feel for the city's more youthful ambiance, highlighted by its urban neighborhoods, marquee art galleries and vibrant farmers markets. While you'll only need a few days to see the city as you know it from your history book, it could take months to experience the Washington that today's locals know and love.

Washington, D.C.'s unforgettable skyline is marked by some of the world's most celebrated monuments. The awe-inspiring structures, statues and temples that grace the National Mall tell fascinating stories through their histories and designs. From the Washington Monument to the World War II Memorial to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, D.C. traces the history of the USA.  But take the time to venture beyond the Mall.

Various companies offer bus and walking tours; others use bicycles, Segways and even amphibious duck boats to show you the sights. Themed tours have also become popular, including scandal and ghost-story narrations. Food-themed tours include craft beer, Italian cuisine and a six-course moveable feast with historical insights.     Dining Culture One of the perennial ""best restaurant cities"" in the U.S., the District's dining scene ranges from sophisticated to down-home, with everything in between. You can enjoy traditional game served with a modern touch, inspired mol¨¦s from Mexico, fine French cuisine, Southern-inspired delights and the greatest concentration of Ethiopian restaurants in any city outside Africa.     Neighborhood Hopping The District, as locals call it, is relatively compact with unique neighborhoods that you can explore easily by foot, bike, cab or Metro.

Performing Arts You'll also find plenty of rich culture, beyond the museums and monuments.

Looking for variety? The Shakespeare Theatre Company is acclaimed for its productions, while The Avant Bard, Constellation, Mosaic and Rorschach theaters offer thought-provoking modern stage works.

But what you might not know is its softer side. The city has over 600 parks, and in the spring, you can see the National Mall all decked out in its famous cherry blossoms. Or, stroll through Georgetown-D.C.'s oldest neighborhood-to find cool shops and restaurants alongside buildings from the 1700s. And while you definitely shouldn't miss the major monuments and Smithsonian museums, there are plenty of lesser-known landmarks, too. Check out Hillwood Estate (go for the Russian and French art, stay for the 13-acre garden), and the Municipal Fish Market-it's the oldest in the U.S. and it's got killer crab cakes.

Plan in advance, and you can even enjoy a magical tour around the White House - a once in a lifetime experience. On the other hand, Washington D.C. offers plenty for thrill seekers and entertainment lovers. Watch NFL, Major League, NBA or NHL matches. Catch a music performance at the Kennedy Center. Visit the fantastic zoo or hop between gourmet restaurants from every part of the world.

If you want to see how politics is done, tours of the White House or Capitol Hill are a must. Take a Tour Through American History Since its founding in 1801, Washington D.C. has seen a lot of history - from the savagery of the Civil War to the Great Depression and the Civil Rights era. You can get a great sense of how America has developed by touring attractions like the Lincoln Memorial, Ford's Theater and the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial.
