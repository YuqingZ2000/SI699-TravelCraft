2,Atlanta,"About AtlantaAtlanta has been dubbed everything from the ""capital of the new South"" and ""the next international city"" to ""the best place to do business."" It's also a great place to visit. Fueled by the prosperity of local mega companies like Coca Cola and Holiday Inn, the prestige of hosting the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and the energy of young upwardly mobile types who have migrated to the city in droves - Atlanta is on fire. And this time it's a good thing. From world-class restaurants and a myriad of cultural attractions to a hip nightlife and sporting events galore, the city is cosmopolitan in every sense of the word. But Atlanta has also managed to maintain its historic character. Stop by the Atlanta History Center or visit the Martin Luther King Jr. Historical Site, a moving tribute to an American icon. Browse through the former home of  famous author Margaret Mitchell or pop into the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum for details on the life and times of the former president and his family. Whether you choose modern urban endeavors or old southern pleasures, Atlanta will not disappoint.","['Bus Tours (51)', 'Historical Tours (53)', 'Parks (131)', 'City Tours (16)', 'Self-guided Tours (16)', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks (26)', 'Movie Tours (8)', 'Cultural Tours (35)', 'Shopping Malls (15)', 'Art Tours (10)', 'Airport & Hotel Transfers (75)', 'Historic Sites (21)', 'Walking Tours (45)', 'Top Picks', 'Theaters (25)', 'Luxury & Special Occasions (18)', 'Likely to Sell Out (15)', 'Specialty Museums (32)', 'Day Trips & Excursions (14)', 'Sightseeing Tickets & Passes (7)', 'Art Museums (11)', 'Special Offer (7)', 'Classes & Workshops (6)', 'Shows, Concerts & Sports (5)', 'Shopping Tours (3)', 'Holiday & Seasonal Tours (1)', 'Theme Parks (1)', 'Weddings & Honeymoons (1)', 'Map']","['Bus Tours', 'Historical Tours', 'Parks', 'City Tours', 'Self-guided Tours', 'Points of Interest & Landmarks', 'Movie Tours', 'Cultural Tours', 'Shopping Malls', 'Art Tours', 'Airport & Hotel Transfers', 'Historic Sites', 'Walking Tours', 'Top Picks', 'Theaters', 'Luxury & Special Occasions', 'Likely to Sell Out', 'Specialty Museums', 'Day Trips & Excursions', 'Sightseeing Tickets & Passes', 'Art Museums', 'Special Offer', 'Classes & Workshops', 'Shows, Concerts & Sports', 'Shopping Tours', 'Holiday & Seasonal Tours', 'Theme Parks', 'Weddings & Honeymoons', 'Map']"

4,Baltimore,"About BaltimoreSince the redevelopment of the Inner Harbor in the late 1970s, Baltimore has set the standard for urban renewal. While a good part of the city's action centers around the fun and festive Harbor area, where street entertainers, open-air concerts, fireworks and parades abound, the surrounding neighborhoods offer all sorts of interesting landmarks, unique shops and delicious restaurants. Wander around Fells Point, the oldest section of Baltimore, reminiscent of an old English village, complete with pubs and cobblestone streets. Take the kids to the aquarium and check out the imaginative creations at the American Visionary Art Museum. Or stop by the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum for an in-depth look at the Great Bambino's life. Baltimore is also renowned for its African-American heritage sites, plus festivals and cultural events that take place throughout the year.

5,Boston,"About BostonIn Boston, you can bump into American history any time you step out the door. Walk the city’s brick-lined Freedom Trail to see historic sites that teleport you back to the Revolutionary War. But Boston is hardly frozen in the past. Every neighborhood has its own vibrant, thriving scene. Spend an afternoon in the North End, taste-testing cannoli from Italian-American bakeries. Or people-watch from a bench in Boston Common, which locals treat as an extension of their living room. It’s worth taking the T out to neighboring Cambridge or Sommerville, especially during charming local festivals like What the Fluff, a festival dedicated to—what else?—marshmallow fluff. Another outing that’s a real classic—Fenway Park.

49,Washington DC,"About Washington DCWashington, D.C.’s rep is spot on: For history and politics, you can’t get any closer to the action. But what you might not know is its softer side. The city has over 600 parks, and in the spring, you can see the National Mall all decked out in its famous cherry blossoms. Or, stroll through Georgetown—D.C.’s oldest neighborhood—to find cool shops and restaurants alongside buildings from the 1700s. And while you definitely shouldn’t miss the major monuments and Smithsonian museums, there are plenty of lesser-known landmarks, too. Check out Hillwood Estate (go for the Russian and French art, stay for the 13-acre garden), and the Municipal Fish Market—it’s the oldest in the U.S. and it’s got killer crab cakes. We’ve got more recs where this came from, below.","['Historical Tours (289)', 'City Tours (124)', 'History Museums (35)', 'Cultural Tours (136)', 'Art Tours (15)', 'Specialty Museums (42)', 'Ghost Tours (11)', 'Half-day Tours (196)', 'Parks (103)', 'Bus Tours (196)', 'Night Tours (30)', 'Art Museums (24)', 'Full-day Tours (39)', 'Self-guided Tours (18)', 'Historic Sites (47)', 'Hop on Hop Off Buses (8)', 'Photography Tours (13)', 'Churches & Cathedrals (43)', 'Mountain Bike Tours (15)', 'Private Day Trips (1)', 'Monuments & Statues (65)', 'Wine Tastings (6)', 'Sporting Events (22)', 'Government Buildings (19)', 'Airport & Hotel Transfers (100)', 'Likely to Sell Out (72)', 'Top Picks', 'Luxury & Special Occasions (94)', 'Holiday & Seasonal Tours (11)', 'Special Offer (9)', 'Multi-day & Extended Tours (8)', 'Ports of Call Tours (8)', 'Sports Lessons  (3)', 'Shopping & Fashion (2)', 'Map']","['Historical Tours', 'City Tours', 'History Museums', 'Cultural Tours', 'Art Tours', 'Specialty Museums', 'Ghost Tours', 'Half-day Tours', 'Parks', 'Bus Tours', 'Night Tours', 'Art Museums', 'Full-day Tours', 'Self-guided Tours', 'Historic Sites', 'Hop on Hop Off Buses', 'Photography Tours', 'Churches & Cathedrals', 'Mountain Bike Tours', 'Private Day Trips', 'Monuments & Statues', 'Wine Tastings', 'Sporting Events', 'Government Buildings', 'Airport & Hotel Transfers', 'Likely to Sell Out', 'Top Picks', 'Luxury & Special Occasions', 'Holiday & Seasonal Tours', 'Special Offer', 'Multi-day & Extended Tours', 'Ports of Call Tours', 'Sports Lessons ', 'Shopping & Fashion', 'Map']"
